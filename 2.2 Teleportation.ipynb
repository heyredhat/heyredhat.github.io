We can find the probabilities of each of the outcomes on A and B using the corresponding projectors. (Incidentally, there should be factors of \\\\( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\) everywhere for the probabilities to work out.) Nature chooses one of the four at random given those probabilities, and we apply the projector corresponding to that outcome. So after the measurement, A and B are in one of those four states, and we've gotten an outcome: 1, 2, 3, or 4. This choice can be described with two bits: 00 01 10 11: hence, the two black nodes. "
