    "The dot above the \\\\(\\psi\\\\) means the change in time of \\\\(\\psi\\\\), in other words, its first derivative. \\\\(\\psi\\\\) is our state vector. \\\\( E \\\\) is the energy operator: \\\\( \\langle \\psi \\mid E \\mid \\psi \\rangle \\\\) is the expected value of the energy. One of the most important equations in linear algebra is the one relating the \"eigenvalues\" and \"eigenvectors\" of an operator.\n",

    "The action of an operator E on an eigenvector \\\\( v \\\\) is just \\\\( v \\\\) multiplied by a scalar \\\\( \\lambda \\\\). \"Eigen\" in German means \"the same.\" So the eigenvectors of an operator are the vectors which are left \"unrotated\" by the operator: the eigenvectors are merely scaled by some eigenvalue. Now the eigenvalues can be complex, leading to a complex rotation, or phase shift, but the vector itself isn't rotated as a whole. And if the eigenvalue is 0, then the eigenvector remains completely unchanged. Now, operators corresponding to \"observables\" in quantum mechanics are Hermitian: in otherwords, they are equal to their conjugate transpose. \\\\( H = H^{\\dagger} \\\\): these matrices have real eigenvalues, so their expectation values are real; and their eigenvectors are all orthogonal, and so they form a complete basis for the space on which they operate. \n",

    "So what is the Schrodinger equation saying? It's saying according to quantum mechanics, the time derivative of an energy eigenstate is just given by the state itself times \\\\(-1j\\lambda\\\\). And if \\\\( \\lambda = 0 \\\\), the state doesn't change at all. So we describe change in quantum mechanics in terms of those states which don't change in time. To wit, if you're in an energy eigenstate, you stay in an energy eigenstate, just phasing around at a certain rate given by the eigenvalue. Superpositions of energy eigenstates, in other words, states with an uncertainty about their energy, correspond to states that *change in time*.\n",

The axis of rotation can be easily obtained:\n",

Remember we can't observe this axis of rotation directly: if we measure X, Y, or Z, we are projecting into an eigenstate with some probability, thus destroying whatever the origional rotation axis was.  Another point is that for a pure state, the (x, y, z) point lies on the surface of the sphere, while for mixed/partial states it lies within the sphere. For the perfectly mixed state (given by, for example, the partial state of the left or right half of a cup), we find (0, 0, 0): there's complete ambiguity about which axis the qubit is spinning around. \n",
