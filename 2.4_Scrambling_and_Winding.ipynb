    "Consider a bunch of qubits evolving under some random unitary operator. If we wanted to run this on a quantum computer, for example, we'd want to compile down that unitary into a series of, say, one and two qubit operators that we apply in a sequence since these are simpler to implement. Consider a single qubit in our group, which starts off separable from the rest. As time goes on, maybe it interacts with another qubit: then, generically, the two qubits will get entangled. Each of those qubits then goes off and gets entangled with more qubits, and now it's possible all four are entangled. And so on. In other words, entanglement spreads between quantum systems like an epidemic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an easy way to get a handle on this. Below is a python implementation of above: a bunch of qubits start of separable, and we evolve them under some randomly selected time evolution. We want to track how one qubit gets entangled with the rest. One easy way to do this is to instead start off with a maximally entangled pair of qubits. One stays outside the group, the other one evolves with the rest of the group. We can then calculate the entanglement between the one who stays outside and all the ones in the group in turn, and track it over time. Think of it like we have two qubits connected by Ariadne's thread; we toss one in and it gets scrambled into the rest, but we can keep track of it by following the thread home.\n",

One way to do this is to use the generalization of the inner product for matrices: \\\\( (tr(H), tr(X^{\\dagger}H), tr(Y^{\\dagger}H), tr(Z^{\\dagger}H)) \\\\). But we know another way: We could multiply I, X, Y, Z and H all by the cup state and then take the normal inner product: \\\\( ( \\langle I\\cup \\mid H \\cup \\rangle , \\langle X \\cup \\mid H \\cup \\rangle , \\langle Y \\cup \\mid H \\cup \\rangle , \\langle Z \\cup \\mid H \\cup \\rangle ) \\\\).\n",

    "And then same goes for the n-qubit case: we take all arrangements of the Pauli operators, and we can expand any operator in the so-called Pauli basis. The point is that in the Pauli basis we can define the notion of the size of an operator. For the 1 qubit case, \\\\(I\\\\) has size 0, while \\\\(X, Y, Z\\\\) each have size 1. In the 2 qubit case, we have 1 operator of size 0, 6 operators of size 1, and 9 operators of size 2. We'll write \\\\( |P| \\\\) for the size of a Pauli operator P. \n",
