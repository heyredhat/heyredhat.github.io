    "To approach SYK (the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev) model, first we need to recall about fermions.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you may know, we (often) classify particles in terms of whether they are bosons or fermions. Generally speaking, bosons are like force particles: examples are the photon, the gluon. Any number of bosons can be in the same state: hence, a laser beam. The bosonic particles are in themselves indistinguishable: they are permutation symmetric. We can use quantum harmonic oscillators to easily keep track of bosonic degrees of freedom. We assign a harmonic oscillator to each degree of freedom of the particle, and the number operator of each oscillator keeps track of how many particles are in *that state*. The use of harmonic oscillators automatically imposes for us that the particles be permutation symmetric. For each oscillator, we have \"creation\" and \"annihilation\" operators, which add and subtract quanta from each oscillator--and although they are not themselves hermitian, they can be used as building blocks for hermitian operators. If we have multiple oscillators, we can just tensor these creation and annihilation operators with identities so they act on the appropriate subspaces. These operators obey the following commutation relations:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ [b_{i}, b_{j}] = [b^{\\dagger}_{i}, b^{\\dagger}_{j}] = 0 $$\n",
    "$$ [b_{i}, b^{\\dagger}_{j}] = \\delta^{i}_{j} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where \\\\( b^{\\dagger} \\\\) is a creation operator, \\\\( b \\\\) is an annihilation operator, and: the commutator is \\\\( [A, B] = AB - BA \\\\). \n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to do the same thing for fermions, we have to make some changes. First, our oscillators can only have 0 or 1 excitations. In other words, at maximum only 1 fermion can be in a given state. This is the Pauli exclusion principle at work. Indeed, the tensor product has to work differently: the whole thing has to do with how fermions are permutation *antisymmetric* particles, unlike bosons which are permutation *symmetric*. So it doesn't matter the order in which we create bosons, but if for fermions: \\\\( f^{\\dagger}_{i} f^{\\dagger}_{j} \\mid 0 \\rangle = -f^{\\dagger}_{i} f^{\\dagger}_{j} \\mid 0 \\rangle \\\\), where \\\\( \\mid 0 \\rangle \\\\) is the fermion vacuum aka the state of all oscillators having 0 quanta.\n",
    "\n",
    "The upshot is that the commutation relations between fermions involve the anticommutator instead of the commutator. The anticommutator is \\\\( \\{A, B\\} = AB + BA \\\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\{f_{i}, f_{j}\\} = \\{f^{\\dagger}_{i}, f^{\\dagger}_{j}\\} = 0 $$\n",
    "$$ \\{f_{i}, f^{\\dagger}_{j}\\} = \\delta^{i}_{j} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "It's not hard to implement this. Suppose we have 5 fermions. The standard 2x2 matrices for creation and annihilation operators are just:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f^{\\dagger} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n",

When the operators are applied to the vacuum in the descending order, the $Z$'s in \\\\( f_{4} \\\\), say, don't matter since there are no excitations in those oscillators: we're in the vacuum after all. But when the operators are applied in the reverse order, they pick up a negative sign from the $Z$'s. You can check that this works\n"
