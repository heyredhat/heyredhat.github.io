    "To approach SYK (the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev) model, first we need to understand about fermions.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you may know, we (often) classify particles in terms of whether they are bosons or fermions. Generally speaking, bosons are like force particles: examples are the photon, the gluon. Any number of bosons can be in the same state: hence, a laser beam. And the bosonic particles are in themselves indistinguishable: they are permutation symmetric. In many cases, we can use quantum harmonic oscillators to easily keep track of bosonic degrees of freedom. We assign a harmonic oscillator to each degree of freedom of the particle, and the number operator of each oscillator keeps track of how many particles are in *that state*. The use of harmonic oscillators automatically imposes for us that the particles be permutation symmetric. We won't go into the details of this here, but save that for a later meeting. For now, let's just observe that in practice, if we work in finite dimensions, we can just cap the maximum number of quanta in a given harmonic oscillator, and get finite dimensional \"creation\" and \"annihilation\" operators, which add and subtract quanta from each oscillator--and although they are not hermitian, they can be used as building blocks for hermitian operators. If we have multiple oscillators, we can just tensor these creation and annihilation operators with identities so they act on the appropriate subspaces. These operators obey the following commutation relations:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ [b_{i}, b_{j}] = [b^{\\dagger}_{i}, b^{\\dagger}_{j}] = 0 $$\n",
    "$$ [b_{i}, b^{\\dagger}_{j}] = \\delta^{i}_{j} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where \\\\( b^{\\dagger} \\\\) is a creation operator, \\\\( b \\\\) is an annihilation operator, and: the commutator is \\\\( [A, B] = AB - BA \\\\). By the way, the anticommutator is \\\\( \\{A, B\\} = AB + BA \\\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to do the same thing for fermions, we have to make some changes. First, our oscillators can only have 0 or 1 excitations. In other words, at maximum only 1 fermion can be in a given state. This is the Pauli exclusion principle at work. Indeed, the tensor product has to work differently: the whole thing has to do with how fermions are permutation *antisymmetric* particles, unlike bosons which are permutation *symmetric*. So it doesn't matter the order in which we create bosons, but if for fermions: \\\\( f^{\\dagger}_{i} f^{\\dagger}_{j} \\mid 0 \\rangle = -f^{\\dagger}_{i} f^{\\dagger}_{j} \\mid 0 \\rangle \\\\), where \\\\( \\mid 0 \\rangle \\\\) is the fermion vacuum aka the state of all oscillators having 0 quanta.\n",
    "\n",
    "The upshot is that the commutation relations between fermions involve the anticommutator instead of the commutator.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\{f_{i}, f_{j}\\} = \\{f^{\\dagger}_{i}, f^{\\dagger}_{j}\\} = 0 $$\n",
    "$$ \\{f_{i}, f^{\\dagger}_{j}\\} = \\delta^{i}_{j} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "So it's not hard to do implement this. Suppose we have 5 fermions. The standard 2x2 matrices for creation and annihilation operators are just:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f^{\\dagger} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n",
    "$$ f = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "To get 5 pairs of creation and annihilation operators with the correct commutation relations, and so which preserve the antisymmetry of the fermions: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f_{0} = f \\otimes I \\otimes I \\otimes I \\otimes I $$\n",
    "$$ f_{1} = Z \\otimes f \\otimes I \\otimes I \\otimes I $$\n",

    "$$ f_{3} = Z \\otimes Z \\otimes Z \\otimes f \\otimes I $$\n",
    "$$ f_{4} = Z \\otimes Z \\otimes Z \\otimes Z \\otimes f $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is that there is a \"normal ordering\" for the fermions. When the operators are applied to the vacuum in the descending order, the Z's in \\\\( f_{4} \\\\), say, don't matter since there are no excitations in those oscillators: we're in the vacuum after all. But when the operators are applied in the reverse order, they pick up a negative sign from the Z's. You can check that this works\n"

    "And now a word of philosophy.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we have this interesting construction. From one perspective, that of the complex fermions, we have a vacuum state with no excitations. From another perspective, that of the left/right fermions, we have two maximally entangled systems. In other words, whether something is in a cup state is somewhat in the eye of the beholder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now in quantum field theory, one often works in the approximation where special relativity holds. Great effort is spent obtaining unitary representations of the Poincare group of space/time translations, rotations and boosts, and the resulting Minkowski vacuum is Poincare invariant. In other words, all observers who are just translated, rotated and boosted from each other agree on the vacuum state, and hence: on what constitutes a particle. \n",
    "\n",
    "But when we consider curved spacetimes and in general accelerated reference frames, it turns out  observers disagree on the vacuum state, and on what constitutes a particle. A famous example is the Unruh radiation. It is predicted that compared to an observer moving inertially, an accelerated observer moving through the same space will detect particles, whereas the inertial observer wouldn't. An observer moving with a constant acceleration divides the world into parts: for example, those parts in the past which can't ever catch up to this observer, and those parts in the future the observer will never be able to reach, due to the finite speed of light, and the fact of they're accelerating. And speaking very broadly, there's a map from the creation and annihilation operators in the inertial frame to creation and annihilation operators in the accelerated frame, and they're related by a linear Bogoliobov transformation, which is a symplectic transformation, which means that it preserves the relationship between position and momentum, creation and annihilation, for all the operators: so that the commutation relations are satisfied on both sides. And there is a whole very deep theory there. In the end, it's like the vacuum in one frame is built out of particle states in the other frame, and particle states in the one frame might correspond to the vacuum state of another. The same trick is used in condensed matter systems. A Bogoliubov transformation can diagonalize any quadratic energy operator: but one ends up with a system \"made\" of different kinds of particles!\n",
    "\n",
    "In our wormhole case specifically, we have one frame: the frame, as it were, from outside the whole system, where the left black hole and the right black hole can be distinguished, and our qubit enters on the left, and comes out on the right. And before things begin, the two black holes (at infinite temperature) are in the maximally entangled CUP state. But there's another frame where the complex fermion number operator is diagonal: there, before the qubit insertion, we're just sitting in the vacuum, a vacuum which is made of equal parts left and right from the other perspective. After all, if you lived your whole life inside the wormhole, you'd never even know there was necessarily a \"left\" and \"right\" side. And the whole wormhole protocol works because we, from the outside, are able to implement the number operator coupling, which is precisely diagonal \"from the inside perspective.\" There's two ways to over come left and right: to be \"inside\" it and so unaware of the difference, or to be \"outside\" it by bringing left and right together to interact.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, if we think about the left and right sides as the \"doubled Hilbert space\" of an operator, then the number operator, which acts across left an right, measures the size of that operator... I was wondering whether you can relate this to the fact that in Ads/CFT, the former is of a dimension higher than the latter.\n",
    "\n",
    "So: whether something is a cup or a cap depends on the particular observer. Different observers in general motion can disagree about what consitutes a particle, disagree about the string diagram that represents the situation. Different observers may join unlike things, cleave other things apart, open themselves up for entry here, closing themselves off there... (So maybe our friend trapped in a loop behind an entangler gate might be able to escape after all, by a complete reconceptualization at the atomic level.)\n",
