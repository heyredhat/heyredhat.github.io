So this equation is true for all points of constant radius from the origin in three dimensions: in other words, a sphere.\n",

All the points on the sphere save one are projected to a unique location on the plane and so can be written as a complex number \\\\( x+iy\\\\). All except the north pole, the point of projection, which we take to be a point beyond every point along the circular planar horizon, a point at infinity. So we map:\n",

If we interpret this as a momentum: \\\\( E^{2} = P_{x}^{2} + P_{y}^{2} + P_{z}^{2} \\\\). In special relativity, this would represent the momentum of a massless particle:\n",

    "\n",
    "And we can interpret this as a photon rushing in or out with a certain color (frequency proportional to energy) in a certain direction in 3D. The fact that a massless particle travels always at the speed of light corresponds to the fact that its 4-vector describes a point on the surface of its sphere. Picture its momentum like an arrow from the center of the sphere to that point: it can't go any faster, that's why the point lies on the surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what if the particle does have a mass? Then it has to travel slower than the speed of light. And this corresponds to a hermitian matrix that can't be broken down into a single outer product, a rank-2 matrix, not a rank-1 matrix. And so it has to be written as a sum \\\\(a\\mid \\psi \\rangle \\langle \\psi \\mid + \\ b\\mid \\phi \\rangle \\langle \\phi \\mid \\\\). And in our representation, this corresponds to a point in the interior of the sphere. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now when we're talking about quantum mechanics, this represents a general mixed state, or density matrix for a qubit. And incidentally, the rule for density matrices generally speaking is that thir eigenvalues are all positive and when normalized sum to 1. So on the one hand, we have the relativistic geometry of the momentum space we actually see around us on the \"celestial sphere\"; and on the other hand, we have the quantum geometry of the qubit, the spin 1/2 particle. And there is an intimate relationship between them as we shall see. And we'll use the fact that it's easy to visualize relativity to visualize the quantum case.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Incidentally, a word to the wise: one can really represent a lot of classical relativity theory in this way including the \"little groups\" of particles. For a massless particle, its hermitian matrices breaks down into a bra and a ket: now these each have an overall complex phase, and if we rotate each of them contrary to each other, they will combine to give the same hermitian matrix as before. So the hermitian matrix is really only defined up to the secret phase between its two parts. So the little group of a massless particle is U(1), the circle group. In other words, we can rotate the polarization of a photon state without changing its momentum. If we have a massless particle, we can break its hermitian matrix into four parts: a sum of two outer products. Now you could wonder: what are all the things you can do to these guys that don't change the Hermitian matrix it represents? It turns out to be (basically) SU(2): in other words, there's a qubit hidden inside there. This is the spin of a massive particle: the little group of a massive particle is SU(2): you can rotate its spin without changing the particle's momentum.) (Basically, you can rotate the inner parts counter to the outer parts, so the hermitian matrix is only defined up to 3D rotation: aka choice of spin axis--like, classically.) But to expound on this would take us too far afield--we're only entering the territory to glean knowledge of quantum mechanical spins.\n",

    "If we think of the entanglement between A and B as a map from A's sphere to B's sphere, then we can see that the image of A's sphere is an ellipsoid. In other words: a squished sphere oriented and placed within the unit sphere. Also shown are the expected values of A and B's spin axes. Cf. [Quantum Steering Ellipsoids](https://arxiv.org/abs/1303.4724) from Jetvic, Pusey, Jennings, et Rudolph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Look at the three different cases. When A and B are separable, the ellipsoid reduces down to B's spin axis. In other words, no matter A's state, B ends up in the same state, which it's already in. So there's no correlation between them. When A and B are generally entangled, B's ellipsoid always surrounds B's spin axis. Due to entanglement, for each possibility of a state A ends up in, B's spin axis gets steered to a corresponding location. Of course, there is still quantum uncertainty, due to the fact that even if B's spin axis gets steered, one still has to choose a axis to measure along and the answer is generally probabalistic. So B doesn't know that B's been steered. Nevertheless, A can control the variations of B around its spin axis, and this is represented by the fatness of the ellipsoid. So fatter ellipsoids are more entangled.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, consider the cup state, the maximally entangled state. A's sphere is mapped to another sphere! But it's flipped upside down along the Y axis. This is because the \\\\( \\mid 00 \\rangle \\ + \\mid 11 \\rangle \\\\) state is entangled specifically in terms of the Z-basis. Now we note that under a Y flip, points on the equator are mapped to themselves. In other words, if we make a measurement on A along the Z axis, then B perfectly correlates with A. But notice that if A were measured along the Y axis, then B would anticorrelate with A.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an interesting way to think about this. Recall before that we needed two coordinate charts to cover the Riemann sphere, one given by stereographic projection from the North Pole vs the South Pole. Well, that's just our Y flip! So when two qubits are maximally entangled we could actually view their spheres as two coordinate charts of the same sphere, the Riemann sphere!"

    "Finally, recall the meaning of the ellipsoid. Each point on A's sphere is mapped somewhere in B's sphere. And the depth of each point in B's sphere corresponds to the probability of the outcome for A. This is because when we do the projection onto A, we're throwing out some information, and so B is steered to a state in a certain direction, but the norm of that state depends on the probability of the original outcome for A. So deeper into the sphere means more improbable; and working outward, things become more probable, until certain when on the surface. \n",
    "\n",
    "But when we measure one half of a pair of entangled particles, the two end up in a separable state. In other words, we end up with two separable pure states with a certain probability. So if we want literally the state B is steered to, we should normalize all the points, projecting them outward onto the surface of the sphere.\n",

As if their entanglement consisted in  nothing more than: them being rotated and boosted relative to each other. But of course, for the qubit, we're talking about its spin, its quantum intrinsic angular momentum, not its classical relativistic momentum. The interpretation is different: suppose you measure spin A to be along some axis: then because of their entanglement, spin B is steered to a certain state. This doesn't determine the outcome with certainty: that depends also on the experimenter's choice to measure X, Y, Z, but the correlation can be perfect if say both experiments agree to measure along the Z axis.

We take the product of three copies of the Paulis for our Hermitian basis. And just as before, we could Lorentz transform the individual indices. But now, there's a kind of hierarchy. Our big Lorentz tensor sends 4-vectors to 16x16 guys and vice versa. In other words, it maps one guy to the rest. If we want to see where a third state is steered to, we have to determine the two.
