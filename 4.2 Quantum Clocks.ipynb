Who could tell if someone moved everything in the universe 3 feet to the left? Nobody! No one in the universe could tell, since everything would have moved equally as everything else. Therefore, although things in the universe have distances relative to each other, the universe as a whole is “nowhere”— there is nothing outside the universe such that a difference of three feet to the left could be noticed. Similarly, who could tell if someone pushed all the clocks forward 5 minutes? There’s no clock outside the universe by which this change could be registered. So things inside the universe change relative to each other; but the universe as a whole has no time: it is timeless or perhaps better yet: time independent.\n",

Consider the eigenstates of the energy operator: on these states, $e^{-iEt}$ acts merely as a phase evolution of the state. A state of definite energy is in this sense “timeless”; only superpositions of energy states evolve in time. If, moreover, the state is an eigenstate with eigenvalue 0, in other words, the state is in the 0 energy subspace of the energy operator, then the quantum state will be completely invariant over time, since the phase evolution is just multiplication by 1. \n",

Before we considered the Feynman and Kitaev constructions, which instigate interactions between the clock and the system in question, which lead to the desired entanglement. What if we do something almost absurdly simpler? What if we demand that the clock and the system have completely separate, independent energy operators? In other words, that they have nothing to do with each other! Indeed, this is more like our traditional conception of a clock, which should just tick away imperviously to what's going on around it.\n",

Maybe you have to rescale some eigenvalues, etc. If there's no 0 eigenvalues, then you could say: those two systems couldn't coexist in the same universe. On the other hand, there might be more than one 0 energy eigenvalue, so that the zero energy subspace is given by linear combinations of the degenerate eigenstates. Now: the conserved quantities of a quantum system are represented by Hermitian operators that commute with the energy operator. And so all operators that commute with our global energy function are timelessly conserved quantities. We can consider evolving the global state via $e^{-iGt}$, for one such operator G with $[G, E] = 0$. This operator will keep us in the zero energy eigenspace, but if there are degeneracies, then this evolution may take us to some superposition of 0 energy eigenstates.
