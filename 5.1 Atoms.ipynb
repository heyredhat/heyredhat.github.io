    "# What is an atom?\n",
    "\n",
    "I don't mean an atom like on the periodic table, which is really a complicated enough thing of its own \"made of\" electrons, protons, neutrons, and so forth. I mean, an actual atom. The word in Ancient Greek means something indivisible. Sometimes \"atomism\" is characterized as the belief that the world is made of tiny little hard impenetrable pebbles whizzing around in empty space, perhaps, according to Lucretius, swerving from time to time in a pique of will. But in a literal sense, atomism is the idea that the world is in some sense composed of indivisibles. We can divide something up, but at some point we won't be able to divide any longer. And what's left are the atoms. \n",
    "\n",
    "One could interpret this \"materialistically\" that what's left is tiny little bits of \"matter\", perhaps differently shaped, perhaps of different substances, that can fit into each other in different ways. But \"idealistically\", we could interpret this as a reflection on the fact that when we analyze an idea, what we do is we reduce it down to a bunch of basic concepts fitted together into a jigsaw; and the most basic concepts have to be taken for granted, atomically. Of course, an idea can be interpreted in many ways, expressed in different ways as a complex of perhaps different basic concepts. So that from one point of view, a concept can be resolved into these atoms; whereas from another point of view, the concept can be resolved into some other notion of atoms. We prove our understanding to each other by demonstrating how we can reduce some shared concept into some agreed upon atoms. And arguably, what we mean by \"understanding\" is the ability to apprehend what something \"is made of\" immediately upon recognizing it. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth observing that when the materialist wants to have their atoms be tiny little \"physical\" cubes or octahedra, knocking around, naturally selecting, in actual practice, what they really need to do is plausibly reduce *all their concepts* down into a single set of basic atomic concepts, which correspond exactly to the ideas of \"the tiny hard impenetrable sphere,\" \"the tiny little pyramid,\" out in the real world. When put this way, it actually seems rather extravagant. While it is \"obvious\" in some sense that ideas can be analyzed into atomic ideas, it would be really quite something if *all* concepts could be reduced to jigsaws made of exactly the same ideas. It would mean all those inequivalent ways of analyzing concepts were really worthless: after all, why not just use the universal ideas, the universal atoms? \n",
    "\n",
    "The materialist could respond: The real world is made up of one set of atoms; it's only in the mind that we can analyze concepts into seemingly different inequivalent atomic schemes, leading to the disagreement and confusion. The response at this juncture can only be that if you're willing to consider that, why not consider the case where, it's only in the mind that all concepts can be reduced down to a single set of ur-concepts (your own!), whereas in the real world, real things can be reduced down to ur-concepts in different inequivalent ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only way to proceed is to actually try to do it: we have to try to divide the world and our concepts into universal atoms and see what happens.\n",

    "So we begin with an atom. We symbolize it with a pebble: $\\Large\\bullet$.  Tiny, hard, impenetrable. Point-like. You can turn over a real pebble in your hand. Of course, you can split an actual pebble, but maybe you imagine splitting it again and again, and eventually maybe you can't split it any more: and we're talking about that, that ur-pebble at the bottom in the dust, separated from its fellow dust. Or from another point of view, we're tracing the roots of our human concept of a \"pebble\" and what we can do with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we have a pebble: $\\Large\\bullet$. What can we do with it? Well, if we had it, we could lose it, get rid of it, take it away. We'll denote the absence of the pebble with $\\Large\\circ$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For later reasons, I want to call what we just did: homogenization. For now, the terminology isn't important. The point is in our way of representing things, we have a way of symbolizing both a thing and its absence. And indeed, this is how we perceive the situation: the empty space there in your hand is just inviting me to place a pebble in it. To understand the concept of a pebble is to see the world as one giant set of opportunities to place a pebble somewhere where it's absent or to take a pebble from where it sits. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, homogenization is necessary for reliable communication. If we can in fact recognize them, we can use the presence or absence of a pebble to communicate something perhaps totally unrelated to the pebble. A little rock on a ledge by a window, a sign that the riots begin tomorrow. But there's a catch! Just the same, we could have prepared a little surprise, which is that it would be precisely the *absence* of the pebble that would signify the riots begin tomorrow, whereas its presence would have signified regrouping. So it's clear: in order to communicate something with a pebble, we have to both understand pebbles, to be able to pick them out of the background of perception, promoting their presence or absence to the foreground, but also: we have to make an ultimately arbitrary choice about whether presence or absence will significant, which one is $0$ and which one is $1$. The choice is arbitrary, but a choice must be made. And this fact means that if we swap pebbles for absences, we can on the flip side correct our rule for signification by swapping them in the same way, riots for regrouping.\n",

    "So far we've just been really considering a single pebble and what we can do with it. \n",
    "\n",
    "But, if $1$ pebble is sitting there, why not put another one beside it? So now we have $2$ pebbles: $ \\Large \\{ \\Large\\bullet, \\Large\\bullet \\}$. We could add another pebble. Then we'd have $3$ pebbles: $ \\Large \\{ \\Large\\bullet, \\Large\\bullet, \\Large\\bullet \\}$. And, all things being equal, there's no limit to our being able to add more pebbles. And so, we've discovered counting up. And naturally, if we can count up, we can count down, removing pebbles until we're back to our original pebble. \n",
    "\n",
    "One way to look at this is that we're providing more context for our pebble $\\Large\\bullet$. Picture it like our pebble is actually floating in an infinite sea of pebble-absences: $ \\Large \\{\\dots, \\Large\\circ, \\Large\\bullet, \\Large\\circ, \\dots \\}$. Each absence represents an opportunity to add another pebble. You can take the bait: $ \\Large \\{\\dots, \\Large\\circ, \\Large\\bullet, \\Large\\bullet, \\dots \\}$, and again: $ \\Large \\{\\dots, \\Large\\bullet, \\Large\\bullet, \\Large\\bullet, \\dots \\}$, without limit: which implies there's always one more $\\Large\\circ$ left no matter how many $\\Large\\bullet$'s you add, just as you started with a single $\\Large\\bullet$ in a sea of $\\Large\\circ$'s. Of course the order doesn't matter. If before we had atoms, we now have composites made of these atoms, in which the atoms all coexist simultaneously, atop each other, however you want to look at it.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've discovered the counting numbers $1, 2, 3, \\dots$. You could picture them like: a bunch of pebbles in a pile. But notice we start counting at 1. This is necessary because we'd like to preserve the original symmetry, the fact that we could swap a pebble for its absence, as well as our interpretations, and still get a successful signification. In this case, we just flip the colors on all the pebbles. You could imagine it as \"a universe which consists on a single pile of pebbles (or absences).\"\n",

    "Well, naturally we'd be interested in having multiple piles of pebbles to play with.\n",
    "\n",
    "What does it mean to group pebbles into piles? We could imagine bringing the pebbles closer and closer together until actually they're in the \"same place,\" but since that's tricky, we signify grouping instead by drawing a circle around the pebbles, or just kind of making a little stack of them in a pile. The order/placement of the pebbles doesn't matter, just the fact that the pebbles are all in there, and there is some number of them. And just as we can have multiple pebbles in a pile, we can have multiple piles lying around. (Living analogously in a single \"pile of piles\" which provides the background context, just as a single pile provided the background context for a single pebble. But to that we will come in time. For now, we're just thinking about having multiple piles.)\n",
    "\n",
    "What's the most basic thing we could do with piles? Well, we could combine piles. This is called \"addition.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\Large \\{ \\Large\\bullet, \\Large\\bullet \\} + \\Large \\{ \\Large\\bullet, \\Large\\bullet, \\Large\\bullet \\} = \\Large \\{ \\Large\\bullet, \\Large\\bullet, \\Large\\bullet, \\Large\\bullet, \\Large\\bullet \\} $\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, $2 + 3 = 5$. We could think of this like iterated counting up: we count up by as many pebbles are in the pile, \"all at once,\" as opposed to one at a time, and if we think in terms of combining piles obviously: $2 + 3 = 3 + 2 = 5$. But if we want an inverse operation, iterated counting down, where we count down by as many pebbles are in a pile, we suddenly have a problem: what if we subtract past 1 to 0 or what's words \"negative numbers\"? For example, $2 - 3 = -1$:\n",

    "Clearly, we have to introduce a second kind of pebble (with its own kind of absence) to keep track of our \"debts.\" The rule is that if a $\\Large\\bullet$ and a $\\Large{\\color{red} \\bullet}$ are in a pile together, we can remove them both: $\\Large \\{ \\Large\\bullet, \\Large{\\color{red} \\bullet} \\} \\rightarrow \\Large\\{ \\}$. So now we can represent an empty pile, $0$, just a circle with nothing in it. Or with colored pebbles themselves as any pile with an equal number of $\\Large\\bullet$'s and $\\Large{\\color{red} \\bullet}$'s. Black and red pebbles can't coexist in a pile together, and so eventually after all the credits and debts cancel out, the pebbles in a pile are all red, all black, or 0. And so we have a new kind of freedom in our representation: we can add arbitrary pairs of black and red pebbles to any pile and this won't change the number that it represents: $\\Large \\{ \\Large\\bullet, \\Large\\bullet,  \\Large{\\color{red} \\bullet}, \\Large{\\color{red} \\bullet}, \\Large{\\color{red} \\bullet}, \\Large{\\color{red} \\bullet}\\} \\rightarrow \\Large\\{ \\Large{\\color{red} \\bullet}, \\Large{\\color{red} \\bullet} \\}$.\n",

If we think about it \"musically,\" $14$ falls on the beat of $2$ and $7$: as I say, every 2nd number is divisible by $2$, every 7th number is divisible by $7$, and both beats fall on $14$.

    "So suppose we have some polynomial $ f(z) = c_{n}z^n + \\dots + c_{4}z^{4} +  c_{3}z^{3} + c_{2}z^{2} + c_{1}z + c_{0}$. Now suppose that we take $z$ to be very large. For a very large $z$ the difference between $z^{n-1}$ and $z^n$ is considerable, and we can say that the polynomial is dominated by the $c_{n}z^n$ term. Now imagine tracing out a big circle in the complex plane corresponding to different values of $z$. If we look at $f(z)$, it'll similarly wind around a circle $n$ times as fast (with a little wiggling as it does so corresponding to the other tiny terms). Now imagine shrinking the $z$ circle down smaller and smaller until $z=0$. But $f(0) = c_{0}$, which is just the constant term. So as the \"input\" circle shrinks down to 0, the \"output\" circle shrinks down to $c_{0}$. To get there, however, the shrinking circle in the output plane must have passed the origin at some point, and therefore the polynomial has at least one root. You factor that root out of the polynomial leading to a polynomial of one less degree, and repeat the argument, until there are no more roots left. Therefore, a degree $n$ polynomial has exactly $n$ roots in the complex numbers.\n",

You can multiply vectors by scalars, and add them up, and you'll always get a vector in the vector space. Implicitly, we've worked with real vector spaces when we used $(x, y)$ and $(x, y, z)$ coordinates. Here, we're working with complex vector spaces. (Note we could use other \"division algebras\" for our scalars: reals, complex numbers, quaternions, or octonions, but complex numbers give us all we need.) But just like real vector spaces, the point is that we can expand any vector in some \"basis.\" For real 3D vectors, we often use $(1,0,0)$, $(0,1,0)$, and $(0,0,1)$. The idea is that any 3D point can be written as a linear combination of these three vectors, which are orthonormal: they are at right angles, and of unit length. \n",

    "In real vector spaces, the length of a vector is given by $\\sqrt{v \\cdot v}$, where $v \\cdot v$ is the inner product: you multiply the entries of the two vectors pairwise and sum. If you take $u \\cdot v$, this quantity will be 0 if the vectors are at right angles. For complex vector spaces, we use the bracket notation $\\langle v \\mid v \\rangle$, where recall that the $\\langle v \\mid$ is a bra, which is the complex conjugated row vector corresponding to the column vector $\\mid v \\rangle$. \n",

Supposing we've quantized along the Z-axis, then $aa*$ is the probability of measuring this qubit to be $\\uparrow$ along the Z direction, and $bb*$ is the probability of measuring it to be $\\downarrow$.

    "It's worth noting: if the state is an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian, then the constellation doesn't change: there's only a phase evolution. Perturbing the state slightly from that eigenstate will cause the stars to precess around their former locations. Further perturbations will eventually cause the stars to begin to swap places, until eventually it because visually unclear which point they had been precessing around."

Even for the spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ case, what's the use of working with a two dimensional complex vector representation?\n",

    "Suppose we have a bar magnet. It has a North Pole and a South Pole, and it's oriented along some axis. Let's say you shoot it through a magnetic field that's stronger in one direction, so that it gets weaker the more you move up, stronger the more you move down. To the extent that the magnet is aligned with or against the magnetic field, it'll be deflected up or deflected down and tilted a little bit. For a big bar magnet, it seems like it can be deflected any continuous amount, depending on the original orientation of the magnet.\n",

Eventually, we reach the \"atoms\" themselves whose electrons are spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ particles, which means they're spinning, and this generates a little magnetic field: to wit, a spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ particle is like the tiniest possible bar magnet. It turns out that what makes a big bar magnet magnetic is that all of its spins are entangled so that they're all pointing in the same direction, leading to a big magnetic field.\n",

    "Here's the surprising thing. It is deflected up or down by some fixed amount, with a certain probability, and if it is deflected up, then it ends up spinning perfectly aligned with the magnetic field; and if it is deflected down, then it ends up spinning perfectly anti-aligned with the magnetic field.

    "To wit, suppose your magnetic field is oriented along the Z-axis. If you have a spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ state $\\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$ represented in the Z-basis, then the probability that the spin will end up in the $\\mid \\uparrow \\rangle$ state is $aa*$ and the probability that the spin will end up in the $\\mid \\downarrow \\rangle$ state is given by $bb*$.

We'd express the vector $\\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$ in terms of the eigenstates of the Y operator or the X operator, etc. We'd get another vector $\\begin{pmatrix} c \\\\ d \\end{pmatrix}$ and $cc*$ would be the probability of getting $\\uparrow$ in the Y direction or getting $\\downarrow$ in the Y direction.\n",

Now given a point on the sphere representing spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ particle's spin axis, you project that point perpendicularly onto the measurement axis. This divides that line segment into two pieces. If you imagine that the line is like an elastic band that snaps randomly in some location, and then the two ends are dragged to the two antipodal points, carrying the projected point with it, the projected point will ends up at one or other of the two antipodal locations with a certain probability, which is indeed the correct probability for that experiment. Note that this simple geometric picture only works for spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$; the generalization to higher spin isn't so easily visualizable, but is basically analogous.\n",

So if we're in the Z-basis we have some $\\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\\\ c \\end{pmatrix}$ and the probability of the first outcome is $aa*$, the second outcome is $bb*$, and the third outcome is $cc*$.\n",

    "\n",
    "The idea is that a big bar magnet could be treated as practically a spin-$\\infty$ particle, with an infinite number of stars at the same point. And so, it \"splits into so many beams\" that it seems like it could end up in a whole continuum of possible locations, so it took so many thousands of years before we realized that (spin) angular momentum is actually quantized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a simple version of a Stern-Gerlach set-up. We make some simplifications. We work in 2D. The particle starts to the left and zips along horizontally to the right. The magnetic field/Z direction is up/down. The particle's Z operator couples to its position along the Z axis. And the magnetic field acts on the spin. Finally, we make a finite approximation which is effectively like putting the particle in a box, so after a while it starts reflecting off the edges. In any case, the probability of the particle to be at a given location is visualized as the radius of the sphere shown at that point. Try changing the particles $j$-value, it's initial state, and even the number of lattice spacings!"

    "If we wanted to be fancy, we could describe a point on a plane $(x, y)$ as being in a \"superposition\" of $(1,0)$ and $(0,1)$. For example, the point $(1,1)$ which makes a diagonal line from the origin would be an equal superposition of being \"horizontal\" and \"vertical.\" In other words, we can add locations up and the sum of two locations is also a location. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's clear that we can describe a point on the plane in many different ways. We could rotate our coordinate system, use any set of two linearly independent vectors in the plane, and write out coordinates for the same point using many different frames of reference. This doesn't have anything to do with the point. The point is where it is. But we could describe it in many, many different ways as different superpositions of different basis states. Nothing weird about that. They just correspond to \"different perspectives\" on that point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example of superposition, in fact, the ur-example if you will is waves. You drop a rock in the water and the water starts rippling outwards. Okay. You wait until the water is calm again, and then you drop another rock in the water at a nearby location and the water ripples outwards, etc. Now suppose you dropped both rocks in at the same time. How will the water ripple? It's just a simple sum of the first two cases. The resulting ripples will be a  sum of the waves from the one rock and the waves from the other rock. In other words, you can superpose waves, and that just makes another wave. This works for waves in water, sound waves, even light waves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Waves are described by differential equations. And solutions to (homogenous) differential equations have the property that a sum of two solutions is also a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose we have a simple ordinary differential equation $y'' + 2y' + y = 0$. The idea is to find some function $y(x)$ such that the sum of its second derivative plus two times its first derivative plus the function equals 0. Suppose we had such a function. And what if we had another function $z(x)$ such that $z'' + 2z' + z = 0$, in other words, $z(x)$ is also a solution to the differential equation? If we took any linear combination of $y$ and $z$ then that will also be a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "E.g:\n",
    "\n",
    "$y'' + 2y' + y = 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "$z'' + 2z' + z = 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "$(y+z)'' + 2(y+z)' + (y+z) = y'' + z'' + 2y' + 2z' + y + z = (y'' + 2y' + y) + (z'' + 2z' + z) = 0 + 0 = 0 $\n",
    "\n",
    "This works because taking the derivative is a linear operator! So that $(y + z)' = y' + z'$.\n",

    "Furthermore, we've seen this happen in terms of our constellations. We can take any two constellations (with the same number of stars) and add them together, and we always get a third constellation. Moreover, any given constellation can be expressed in a multitude of ways, as a complex linear combination of (linearly independent) constellations.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could take one at the same constellation and express it as a complex linear superposition of X eigenstates, Y eigenstates, or any eigenstates of some Hermitian operator. The nice thing about Hermitian operators is that their eigenvectors are all orthogonal, and so we can use them as a basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the constellation is how it is, but it can be described in different reference frames in different ways, as a superposition of different basis constellations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the daring thing about quantum mechanics is that is says that basically, everything is just like waves. If you have one state of a physical system and another state of a physical system, then if you add them up, you get another state of the physical system. In theory, everything obeys the superposition principle!\n",
    "\n",
    "There is something mysterious about this, but not in the way it's usually framed. Considering a spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ particle, it seems bizarre to say that its quantum state is a linear superposition of being $\\uparrow$ and $\\downarrow$ along the Z axis. But we've seen that it's not bizarre at all! Any point on the sphere can be written as linear superposition of $\\uparrow$ and $\\downarrow$ along some axis! So that you really can imagine that the spin is definitely just spinning around some definite axis, given by a point on the sphere. But when you go to measure it, you pick out a certain special axis: the axis you're measuring along. You can express the point in a sphere as a linear combination of $\\uparrow$ and $\\downarrow$ along that axis, and then $aa*$ and $bb*$ give you the probabilities that you get either the one or the other outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the particle may be spinning totally concretely around some axis, but when you go to measure it, you just get one outcome or the other with a certain probability. You can only reconstruct what that axis must have been before you measured it by preparing lots of such particles in the same state, and measuring them all in order to empirically determine the probabilities. In fact, to nail down the state you have to calculate (given some choice of X, Y and Z) $(\\langle \\psi \\mid X \\mid \\psi \\rangle, \\langle \\psi \\mid Y \\mid \\psi \\rangle, \\langle \\psi \\mid Z \\mid \\psi \\rangle)$, in other words, you have to do the experiement a bunch of times measuring the (identically prepared) particles along three orthogonal axes, and get the proportions of outcomes in each of those cases, weight those probabilities by the eigenvalues of X, Y, Z, and then you'll get the $(x, y, z)$ coordinate of the spin's axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "So yeah, we could just represent our spin-$j$ state as a set of $(x, y, z)$ points on the sphere. But it's better to use the *unitary* representation, as a complex vector, because then we can describe the constellation as a superposition of *outcomes to an experimental situation* where the components of the vector have the interpretation of *probability amplitudes* whose \"squares\" give the probability for that outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, quantum mechanics effects a radical generalization of the idea of a perspective shift or reference frame. We normally think of a reference frame as provided by three orthogonal axis in 3D, say, by my thumb, pointer finger, and middle finger splayed out. In quantum mechanics, the idea is that *an experimental situation* provides a reference frame in the form of a Hermitian operator--an *observable*--whose eigenstates provide \"axes\" along which we can decompose the state of system, even as the correspond to *possible outcomes to the experiment*. The projection of the state on each of these axes gives the probability (amplitude) of that outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's an amazing twist on the positivist idea of describing everything as a black box: some things go in, some things come out, and you look at the probabilities of the outcomes, and anything else one must pass over in silence. And that's all one can hope for. In the spin case, we can see that this works, but with a twist: the spin state is a superposition of \"possible outcomes to the experiment,\" which at first seems metaphysically bizarre, but this superposition can also be interpreted geometrically as: a perfectly concrete constellation on the sphere. (Indeed, you can interpret the \"stars\" in the constellations as little vortices, little tornados, churning the sphere around--more on this momentarily.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, Dirac writes in his Principles of Quantum Mechanics, \"[QM] requires us to assume that ... whenever the system is definitely in one state we can consider it as being partly in each of two or more other states. The original state must be regarded as the result of a kind of superposition of the two or more new states, in a way that cannot be conceived on classical ideas.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, Schrodinger proposed his cat as a kind of reductio ad absurdum to the universal applicability of quantum ideas. He asks us to consider whether a cat can be in a superposition of $\\mid alive \\rangle \\ + \\mid dead \\rangle$. Such a superposition seems quite magical if we're considering a cat. How can a cat be both alive and dead? And yet, the analogous question for a spin isn't mysterious at all. How can a spin be in a superposition of $\\mid \\uparrow \\rangle \\ + \\mid \\downarrow \\rangle$ (in the Z basis)? Easily! It's just pointed in the X+ direction! The analogous thing for a cat would be something like $\\mid alive \\rangle \\ + \\mid dead \\rangle = \\mid sick? \\rangle$--I don't propose that seriously, other than to emphasize that what the superposition principle is saying is that superpositions of states *have to be perfectly good comprehensible states of the system as well*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of a quantum spin, we can see that we can regard the spin's constellation as being perfectly definite, but describable from many different reference frames, different linearly independent sets of constellations. Which reference frame you use is quite irrelevant to the constellation, of course, until you go to measure it, and then the spin ends up in one of the reference states with a certain probability. So the mystery isn't superposition per se; it has something to do with measurement. (You might ask how this plays out in non-spin cases, for example, superpositions of position: I'll return to this issue.) \n",
    "\n",
    "You might ask: Doesn't the *actual* Hamiltonian fix a basis? Sure, but the Hamiltonian can change. The deeper question is: we prepare a spin in some superposition, and we can regard it as definitely having a certain constellation, but implicitly, since we prepared the spin, we fixed what we mean by the X, Y, Z axes. This is implicit in our ability to even represent the particle's state relative to us. But what if we hadn't done that, so that we didn't necessarily have any shared reference frame between us? Are we allowed to still say that the particle as a \"definite constellation\"? We return to these questions later on when we briefly discuss spin networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "One nice analogy is the idea of a \"forced choice question.\" I show you a picture of a diagonal line and I ask you is it a vertical line or a horizontal line? And you're like it's both! It's equal parts vertical and horizontal! How can I choose? I have as many reasons to choose vertical or horizontal? If the line were inclined a little to the horizontal, then maybe I'd be inclined to say it was horizontal more than vertical, although not by much! But I force you to choose. You have to pick one! What do you do? You have to make a choice, but there is literally no reason for you to choose one or the other, in the sense that you have as many reasons to choose horizontal as to choose vertical. And so, you have to choose randomly. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's the same with the spin. Suppose it's spinning in the X+ direction. And I ask it, Are you up or down along the Z axis? Well, both! In terms of the question, it's equal parts up and down in the Z direction. But the experimental situation forces the particle to give some answer, and it has as many reasons to choose the one or the other, and so it just... picks one at random! In other words, this is the ultimate origin for quantum indeterminism: you've forced a physical system to make a choice, but it has no reason to choose: and so, it just decides for itself. It's like: you ask a stupid question, you get a stupid answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a old folktale from the Middle Ages called Buridan's Ass or the Philosopher's Donkey. The old donkey has been ridden hard by the philosopher all day, and by evening, it's both hungry and thirsty. The philosopher (being, who knows, perhaps in an experimental mindset) lays out a bucket of water and a bucket of oats before the donkey. The donkey is really hungry, so it wants to go for the oats, but it's also really thirsty, so it wants to go for the water. In fact, it's just as hungry as it is thirsty. It has to pick oats or water to dig into first, but it has as many reasons to pick the oats first as the water first, and so it looks back and forth and back and forth, and can't decide, and eventually passes out, steam coming out of its ears.\n",
    "\n",
    "Leibniz articulated something called the Principle of Sufficient Reason, which was once very popular, and it basically said that: everything happens for a reason. The donkey exposes the consequence of this idea. If everything has to happen for a reason, and the donkey has as many reasons to choose the water as the oats, then the donkey can't do anything, since there would be no reason for choosing one over the other. And so, the donkey keels over--for what reason? It had as many reasons to choose the water as the oats.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum mechanics strongly suggests that the Principle of Sufficient Reason is false. Nature, as it were, cuts the Gordian knot of the philosopher. An X+ spin presented with a bucket of $\\uparrow$ and a bucket of $\\downarrow$ doesn't glitch out, even though it has as many reasons to choose the one as the other. Instead: it just fucking picks one, for no reason at all. It decides all on its own without any help from \"reasons.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "If the spin had been in the Z+ state, of course, and we asked $\\uparrow$ or $\\downarrow$ along the Z axis, then it would answer up with certainty, and vice versa for Z-.\n",
    "\n",
    "A further point. A spin in itself can be described in terms of its constellation. This constellation can be described from many points of view, each corresponding to some \"observable,\" some experimental situation, which as it were provides a filter, separating out this outcome from that outcome. We can also think about this in terms of entanglement. In the Stern-Gerlach apparatus, we actually measure the position of the particle, which has become entangled with the spin, so that if the particle is deflected up, it's spin is $\\uparrow$ and if it's deflected down, it's spin is $\\downarrow$. So that even though the particle's constellation is defined intrinsically, regardless of reference frame, the entanglement between the particle's spin and its position provides a reference frame, in that some (arbitrary) basis states of the particle's spin are paired with some (arbitrary) basis states of the particle's position. So that now there is a dependency between the outcomes. If the particle is measured to be here, then it's spin will be $\\uparrow$. If the particle is measured to be there, then it's spin will be $\\downarrow$--and vice versa. (You might wonder how we know that the spin's state at all? Well, if we measure a spin to be $\\uparrow$ along the Z-axis, and then send it through another Stern-Gerlach set-up oriented along the Z-axis, then it'll always deflect up, but if we set it through a X-oriented apparatus, it'll give $\\uparrow$ or $\\downarrow$ with equal probability, etc--and the spin state explains why this is the case, which can't be derived from the position state alone.)\n",
    "\n",
    "So although the reference frame by which we describe something is arbitrary, things can get entangled which pairs basis states of the one with basis states of the other, so that each pairing of basis states now has its own probability, and the pairs are all in superposition, leading to correlations between the outcomes of experiments done on the two things.\n",
    "\n",
    "So that, while in its own terms the spin has its constellation, it interfaces with the world via some decomposition of that constellation into a superposition over \"experimental outcomes\" (which are constellations themselves), which can get entangled with other outcomes of other systems. So that the in itself arbitrary decomposition of the constellation into basis constellations provides the hooks by which the spin becomes correlated with the rest of the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Returning to the pebble. If at first, to communicate with a pebble, we had to agree on whether an absence or a presence was significant, then on where to start counting, and then where 0 was, and then what rational number translated between our different notions of \"1\", and then a complex number to rotate from my axis to your axis, now we need to specify the basis vectors in terms of which we've written our \"polynomial.\" This could mean: the 3D coordinate frame for some $(x, y, z)$ point, but in the general case, the basis vectors are bundled into a Hermitian matrix representing a quantum observable, so that to specify the basis vectors is to: specify which experiment you did. To wit, I do the Stern-Gerlach experiment, and I put a pebble in pile A if I got up, and a pebble in pile B if I got down. In order to successfully communicate to you what I mean by those pebbles, I have to specify: what experiment provided the reference frame for those outcomes, and which eigenvalue/eigenvector pair the pebble corresponds to. Then we can both compute the proportions between the outcomes, and reconstruct the state of the physical system, and we three will all be in agreement about what we're talking about.)"

In the finite dimensional spin case, if you had a spin-$j$ state, then the coherent states would be all the states with $2j$ stars in the same location. They have very interesting properties.

    "So anyway this is interesting. We can represent our spin-$j$ state as: a set of roots/$(x, y, z)$ points, a single variable polynomial, a homogeneous two variable polynomial, a $\\mid j, m \\rangle$ state, and also a state of $2j$ symmeterized spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$'s. In the latter case, we can swap any of the symmeterized qubits and this doesn't change the constellation. Indeed, the constellation is \"holistically\" encoded in the entanglement between the parts and not in the parts (qubits) individually. What does this mean? Well, suppose we just rotate a single one of the symmeterized qubits around the X axis a bit. This won't lead to a rigid rotation of the whole sphere. In fact, we're no longer in a permutation symmetry state! But a local rotation can't change the entanglement between the parts in any way. And yet: if we then rotate the rest of the qubits in exactly the same, we can recover our original constellation (just rotated around the X-axis)! In other words, the constellation isn't ultimately affected by local rotations of the qubits: we can rotate all the qubits separately locally, but the constellation is still in there somewhere--there will always be a way to undo all those changes and recover the constellation by acting locally separately on the qubits. In this sense, the constellation is encoded in the entanglement of the whole and not in the parts.\n",

    "There's an idea that goes by the name SLOCC: Stochastic Local Operations and Classical Communication. The idea is: we want to describe what's invariant about a multipartite quantum state, in other words, characterize its entanglement structure, supposing we can: act separately with unitaries on the parts, classically communicate to each each other (like if we each had one of the parts), and also: entangle our part with some auxilliary system (which will change the entanglement structure), but then measure the auxilliary system (which will restore the entanglement structure). In this context, if we do the same auxilliary operation to all the qubits, we can *boost* the constellation: we can get not just SU(2), but also SL(2,C). By coordinating our local operations, we can always recover the original constellation by local ops: we can always turn local rotations/boosts into global rotations/boosts by making sure each qubit is rotated in the same way."

    "\n",
    "First we define $\\epsilon = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$: it's just the (unnormalized) antisymmetric state of two spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$'s. Now suppose we have two spins with $j_{1}$ and $j_{2}$, each represented as the symmetrized tensor product of $2j$ spinors. We tensor them together. If we then symmeterize over *all* the spinors, we obtain a spin-($j_{1} + j_{2}$) state. Its constellation is just given by: the constellation of the first spin overlaid with the constellation of the second spin. If we had two spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$'s, this would be the spin-$1$ state. To get the rest of the states, before we symmeterize, we contracte $k$ spinors of the first group with $k$ spinors of the second group using the $\\epsilon$. In other words, we contract a spinor from the first group with the first spinor in $\\epsilon$ and a spinor from the second group with the second spinor in $\\epsilon$. Once we've contracted k spinors, we symmeterize the $2(j_{1} + j_{2} - k)$ spinors which are left. And by going over all the possible k's, we obtain the Clebsch-Gordan decomposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the normalization of the states is a little tricky so let's ignore that! It's the principle that matters. To get each lower state, we remove a star's worth of angular momentum from each of the two groups: and because we use $\\epsilon$ to do our contractions, the overall state gets multiplied by a factor that depends on the degree to which the removed quanta point in opposite directions. (Note because of the permutation symmetry, it doesn't matter which spinors we choose to contract within a group!)"

    "Now there's so much one could talk about here. One could talk about spin networks, originally developed by Penrose in the 60's. You imagine a network of spin interactions, with edges labeled by $j$ values consistent with the addition of angular momenta. It turns out you can extract probabilities from a closed network without ever specifying the states per se, just the j values at the interactions--and these probabilities happen to be rational numbers. Penrose's motivation was an example of how space can emerge out of interaction. His reasoning was that we can only assign a state to a spin relative to some X, Y, Z axes, which presupposed that 3D space exists. So instead of specifying the $\\mid j, m \\rangle$ state, he just wants to specify the $j$ values. He then wonders what happens when you consider the limit of large networks and high spin $j$'s, and he proves the Spin Geometry Theorem. The idea is this, suppose you have a large network, and in that context, a large $j$ spin. You could imagine it interacts with a single spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ particle. Now either the interaction will result in a $j+\\frac{1}{2}$ or a $j-\\frac{1}{2}$ state, depending on the angle between the spins. But we know how to calculate probabilities using the spin network itself! (The rules are interesting and relate to our string diagram language from before, where the role of cup and cap is played by the $\\epsilon$. But we won't go into details here.) So imagine the network where the interaction results in a $j+\\frac{1}{2}$, and get the probability; and then the network where the interaction results in a $j-\\frac{1}{2}$, and get the probability. These two probabilities should relate to the angle between the spin's rotation axes, which we havn't determined at all, and so we work backwards from the probabilities to the angles. Actually one imagines doing this twice to separate out classical uncertainty from quantum uncertainty (see his original paper for details!). Anyway, you could imagine doing this \"experiment\" for any spins in your network, but it's not clear that the angles so obtained will be consistent with each other. One might find that A and B have this angle between them, and B and C have that angle between them, which in normal 3D space would imply something about A and C's angle; but here this isn't generally the case. Penrose, however, shows that in the limit of big networks and high spin-$j$, that the angles between the spins become consistent with each other as if there were all embedded consistently in an emergent 3D geometry. \n",

    "Such ideas have been explored in other forms in loop quantum gravity. Again, we'll save the details for another time, but for example, one can consider the tensor product of a bunch of spins, and demand that they live in the angular momentum 0 subspace, which may have some number of dimensions. If you do this, then these states act like an \"intertwiner,\" an angular momentum preserving interaction vertex, and the spins can be interpreted as the faces of a *quantum polyhedron* living at that vertex, where the $j$ values now refer to the areas of the face. It turns out the best way to quantize polyhedra is in terms of Minkowski's theorem, which says that a polyhedron is uniquely specified by the normal vectors to each of its faces, multiplied by their areas, all of which sum to 0 if the polyhedron is closed. But we digress... (Okay one more thing: there's an intimate relationship between quantum spin and Bezier curves, the components of the $\\mid j, m \\rangle$ vector being like the control points of a complexified Bezier curve! What!)"

    "\n",

    "So this gives us a model for the polarization state of a photon, ignoring its momentum. Our double oscillator construction gives us a model of potentially several photons, all sharing the same momentum.

(A photon is technically a spin-$1$ particle, but because it's massless, it has only two possible states, hence its polarization is described by a qubit.)\n",

    "\n",
    "We began (1) by investigating our most basic idea of a \"pebble.\" We could place a pebble somewhere, and we could take it away. To communicate with a pebble, we had to agree on whether presence or absence would be significant. \n",
    "\n",
    "We then engaged in a mathematical dialectic. We imagined that anything we could do once, we could do again. So we could place another pebble, and another, and another. And make a little pile of indistinguishable pebbles which we could also take away from. And so we invented the counting numbers (2). The rule was we could repeat an action, but we always had to be able to go backwards too. Indeed, to communicate with a counting number, we have to agree on what number we start counting from. We can conceive of this as a contextualization of our original pebble: this pebble is actually the 4th pebble, if you've been keeping count, and to keep count is: to build up a little pile. So the pile is a contextualization of the pebble.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then (3), we could imagine repeating \"counting\" itself, counting \"all at once,\" and so we invented addition, or combining piles. We had to have an inverse, and so we invented the negative numbers, when it became clear that we could subtract past 0. And thus, we found the \"integers.\" To communicate with an integer, we have to agree on what is 0, and also which direction we're in, positive or negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then (4), we imagined iterating addition to get multiplication, whose inverse is division. We thus found the rational numbers, or piles of \"prime pebbles.\" We can now yet further contextualize: we can specify a rational number which translates between your units and my units, between our different ideas of \"1\". We also noticed that allowing division by 0 wraps the number line into a circle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then (5), we imagined iterating multiplication to get exponentiation, whose inverse is root-taking. We thus discovered the irrational numbers like the $\\sqrt 2$, but also the complex numbers $a + b\\sqrt{-1}$. We could thus rotate between two coordinate axes, turning irrationals into rationals, and back. We investigated meaning of a \"limit\" and how at this stage the numbers turn reflexive, leading us to reflect on the general theory of computation and its limitations. We observed that no single set of logical atoms which are powerful enough to axiomatize arthimetic is complete in the sense that it can prove all true theorems about itself, and indeed, one such undecidable statement is the consistency of that formal system itself, in other words, if it leads to a contradiction. In other to prove the consistency of such a logical system, one as to move to a larger, more powerful system, adding axioms, which leads to yet other undecidable truths, which can be decided with yet more axioms. The point being is that: one can't start from a single set of axioms and rules for inference and imagine a machine trying out every possible rearrangement of symbols and thus proving all possible theorems. And so we proved that conceptually, there can't be a single set of \"master concepts\" from which all concepts can be mechanically derived. Hence, one requires a *dialectical* unfolding of mathematical ideas alongside the purely deductive. And indeed, that's exactly what we've been doing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then (6), we began by considering an unordered set of complex numbers, which we associated to points on the plane/sphere, and realized we could interpret them as the roots of a polynomial, giving us a yet higher order version of the idea of a \"pile of pebbles\": an *equation*. And we developed an interpretation of polynomials as \"quantum states,\" indeed, as the states of spin-$j$ particles. Polynomials brought with them the idea of vector spaces, and we realized that polynomials were only defined up to a set of basis vectors, and that Hermitian matrices, which are observables in quantum mechanics, provide such basis sets via their eigenvectors. And so, to give context to our polynomials, to correctly communicate a quantum state, we had to specify a set of basis polynomials. Linear algebra provides the theory of generalized \"perspective switches,\" and we realized we could generalize our idea of perspective to that of an \"experimental situation,\" by which a state is filtered probablistically into outcome states, which provide a complete basis for the state: re the Stern-Gerlach apparatus. And we realized the importance, therefore, of unitary representations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Vector spaces, as well, bring with them the idea of the tensor product, and we realized that the symmetric tensor product of $2j$ spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ states gives us a representation of a spin-$j$ state. And this was interesting because it involved entanglement between potentially spatially separate systems. In one of the great defeats of all time, entanglement provdes that any simple reductionism can't work in science. What particles get entangled, there is more information in the whole than in the parts. For example, in the antisymmetric state, two spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ particles, each are maximally uncertain with regard to their rotation axis, but their entanglement means that they must always point in the opposite direction. So that if one is measured to be $\\uparrow$, the other one must be $\\downarrow$. Of course, through repeated experiementation on the two particles, one could precisely determine the quantum state of the whole. But for each instance of the experiment, there is more information contained in the two particles together, than can be separated into the two spatially separate parts. To wit, we found that our constellation was encoded not individually in any of the symmetric spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ particles, but in the entanglement between them. What's more, however, when we consider the constellation itself: it is just a simple juxtaposition, a product of roots; so that it seems that even if have a situation where an entangled whole is greater than its parts, from another perspective, we can describe it as a whole (constellation) which is a simple sum of its parts (stars). We digressed to discuss the theory of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, and the idea that the tensor product of a bunch of spins could be split into separate sectors, turning the AND of the tensor product into the OR of a choice. And so we arrived at the theory of angular momentum conserving interactions, and alluded to spin networks. (Indeed, this construction can be generalized to other types of interactions that conserve other quantities besides angular momentum.) \n",
    "\n",
    "We then discussed the idea of second quantization. We realized that polynomials (without the Majorana interpretation, in other words, generally infinite dimensional) also provide a representation of a quantum harmonic oscillator, full of indistinguishable, countable energy quanta. And we imagined introducing a quantum harmonic oscillator to each degree of freedom of a first quantized quantum system. In our case, we introduced two harmonic oscillators, one each for the $\\uparrow$ state and the $\\downarrow$ state of a spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$. And the fixed total energy subspaces of this Hilbert space turned out to correspond to spin-$0$, spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$, spin-$1$, $\\dots$ states, each of them indeed being a permutation symmetric state of spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$'s.\n",
    "\n",
    "And so we developed a representation capable of expressing a superposition of spins with different $j$ values, which was also a representation of the polarization of light. It turned out to be a theory of indistinguishable particles, and all known actual particles are of this type, quanta of some quantum field, albeit much more complex. It's then clear we could rephrase our theory of spin in terms of the repeated measurements of \"the number of quanta in the $\\uparrow$ oscillator\" and \"the number of quanta in the $\\downarrow$ oscillator,\" and that due to second quantization, we can think about any measurement, in some sense, as being reducible to the measurement of *some* number operator. And so we've come full circle: we can now contextualize our pebbles as counting the number of quanta of some mode of a quantum field. Indeed, we could say that the world is conceptually made of \"pebbles\" insofar as we can use pebbles, appropriately contextualized, to represent it. And any actual clay pebble has emerged in some limit of this quantum theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "But one thing that is also clear is that there can be many perspectives conceptually on the same quantum system. We have a constellation. Is it a spin-$j$ particle? Is it $2j$ spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$'s, is it two quantum harmonic oscillators, is it the polarization of a beam of photons? The interpretation is physically fixed by how the system interacts with the rest of the world; and conceptually each new  interpretation brings with it a whole unheralded set of ideas and connections to the rest of the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although there is a notion of identity that persists through different physical representations. If my spin is entangled with other spins, then if I split it into symmeterized spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$'s, then these guys as whole will still be entangled with the rest of the world in the same way. So that even if something is transformed into different physical systems it still retains its unique connection to the rest of the universe. To wit, I can load a given quantum state into a quantum computer made of spins, of light, of whatever, and this won't in principle affect its entanglement in anyway. So it really is *that unique non-clonable* quantum state that you have there, and not merely a *representation*, a *copy* of it, as would be the case if you loaded in some classical data into your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, when one works in relativistic quantum field theory, a basic demand is that the vacuum state (with no particles) is Lorentz invariant. In other words, translated, rotated, boosted observers all agree on the vacuum state, indeed, on the idea of \"what is a particle.\" This theory leads to Wigner's classification scheme. The idea is that what we mean by a \"particle\" anyway is whatever is invariant, or the same, whether we rotate it, whether we translate it, whether we translate by it, whether we see it while moving at top speed, etc. In other words, we define a particle in terms of what we can do that leaves it the same, that thing which is invariant underneath the different perspectives we might have on it, in this case, spatio-temporal perspectives. Hence the importance of group theory. Indeed, today in the field of neural networks, people are starting to build networks which respect the underlying group structure of some domain, learning representations of images that are translation invariant in the place, and so forth. The idea being that would a neural network should be able to recognize the identity of something even if it's seen askew.\n",
    "\n",
    "But when one moves to field theory in a curved space, one must employ (not necessarily unitary) symplectic transformations between perspectives. Famously, in the Unruh effect, while a stationary observer in the vacuum measures 0 particles, an accelerated observer experiences a different vacuum state, indeed, one with a non-0 number of particles! A symplectic transformation is one that maps creation and annihilation operators to different creation and annihilation operators while preserving the fact that they are, indeed, creation and annihilation operators. So that the $a/a^{\\dagger}$'s in the accelerated reference frame are built out of the $a/a^{\\dagger}$'s in the rest frame, in a particular way relating to the acceleration. Indeed, there is a class of symplectic transformations known as Bogoliubov transformations, which can turn any Hamiltonian quadratic in the creation and annihilation operators, into a simple oscillator Hamiltonian: $\\sum_{i} a^{\\dagger}a$, etc. This can be used in condensed matter, to describe how in certain systems electrons pair up to rove around as meta-particles. So that, what is one set of particles from one point of view may be another set of particles from another point of view. This reaches its culmination in holographic theory, where one as for, example, a conformal field theory on the boundary of some space (like on the surface of the sphere) is from another point of view a gravitational theory in the interior of that space (like in the interior of the sphere), usually an anti-DeSitter space, one with negative curvature, so that signals going off to infinity, return in finite time--just like the inside of a black hole. Indeed, that was the motivation: one wants to regard the seemingly inaccessible quantum state of the interior of the black hole (including the things that fall into it) as being, from another perspective, the quantum state that lives on a surface, the event horizon (and also the Hawking radiation). In these models, there is an interesting connection between phenomena that extend across large scales of the boundary and phenomena occur deep in the interior of bulk of the \"emergent spacetime.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "And so realize that even a quantum field has to contextualized with reference to some observer: one inside the black hole vs one outside.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, step by step, as it has unfolded, our story has been as much about translating between the perspective of observers (so that communication can be successful) as it has been about the pebbles which are passed between them. And so we have to ask: what is an observer, anyway? We have a theory that allows observers to come to agreement about the way the world is independent of their perspectives, using mathematics to represent the relationship between their points of view, so that they don't get out of synch. But the observers themselves, as it were, stand outside the theory as such, as *users* of the theory, which provides a reliable means of guaranteeing communication and agreement."

    "There is something kinda magical about the mathematics behind quantum spin. It's almost too easy, the sphere the center of a remarkable series of coincidences, the way we can view points on n-spheres as (n-2)-stars on the 2-sphere, that the space of quantum states of a spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ particle is just the same space of the classical states of a spinning top. There is a theory that generalizes this idea called \"Geometric Quantization,\" and the full story isn't complete. But generally, one investigates how copies of classical system can be interpreted as states of a corresponding quantum system. \n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of coherent states also applies to the harmonic oscillator: the simplest example is a Gaussian wave packet, and indeed they provide a basis for all the states of the oscillator, just as the coherent states of $2j$ points at the same place on the sphere, across the sphere, provide a basis of states for a spin-$j$ particle. (Incidentally, you can look at an infinite dimensional polynomial as being determined by an infinite number of roots, but there are some subtleties, re: Weierstrass factorization theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "I bring this up because it's very nice to be able to say, with regard to a spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ say, well, it's point in the X+ direction, but you asked, is it $\\uparrow$ or $\\downarrow$ in the Z direction, and that's a dumb question since it's equally both, and so you get a dumb answer: it's $\\uparrow$ or $\\downarrow$ at random. And that, even though the system can be quantized in terms of these outcomes ($Z-\\uparrow$ and $Z-\\downarrow$), in itself, it's just pointed along the X+ direction, perfectly definitely. In other words, superpositions of constellations are sensible constellations as well, unlike the situation of a dead cat plus an alive cat.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what about a position state, where the particle is in a superposition of being at location A and location B? I ask, is it at A? And it's a dumb question because it's at A *and* at B, but I forced it to choose, and so maybe it's there or not. But in the spin case, the equivalent of being at A *and* B was a perfectly comprehensible, classical, if you will state: it was just pointed in some direction on the sphere. But classically, you can't have one thing in two places at once. And so it seems like our luck has run out. \n",
    "\n",
    "Arguably, we can't answer this question until we have a final theory of quantum gravity, and really nail down what we mean by \"position\" anyway. But here's something I was thinking about.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe it's like, if the particle is at A *and* B for me, whereas I'm definitely here, then perhaps symmetrically for the particle, it's definitely \"here\", and I'm the one at two possible locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "On that same note, one could (and some have tried) to replace the idea of a position with that of a \"view.\" Whereas I can't imagine a superposition of \"particle at A\" and \"particle at B\" being itself a classical oridnary state of a particle's position, I could imagine that a superposition of a particle being seen from the left, and a superposition of a particle being seen from the right, is just: particle being seen from head on. \n",
    "\n",
    "And so, I leave you on this note. There is an interesting conjecture by Atiyah which says: if you arrange n non-coincident points in 3D, and then imagine a little sphere around each point, and imagine drawing straight lines between the points, the lights intersect the spheres, and put a star at each intersection point. So each point has a constellation on a sphere associated to it which is its \"view\" of the other points. So we have $n$ constellations, each of $n-1$ stars. We can interpret these $n-1$ stars as an $n$ dimensional spin state, or as polynomials. Atiyah has conjectured, and no one has found a counterexample, that these states always form a linearly independent basis for constellations of $n-1$ stars. In other words, the mutual views of each other of points arranged in 3D always form a linearly independent basis of the space of possible views. Of course, not all collections of constellations form consistent views. Nor is this in general an orthogonal basis, and so the components can't be interpreted so neatly as probability amplitudes. But given a $n-1$ star constellation, we can express it in the basis provided by a collection of $n$ views, and so give a kind of weight to the degree to which that constellation is \"at\" those vantage points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Who knows! But it is certaintly true that our basic experience of being situated in the world is not being \"at a position\" per se, but instead: being surrounded by a sphere of incoming momenta, carrying views of the world with them. (Atiyah generalizes his conjecture to hyperbolic space, Minkowski space, curved space, more general manifolds, etc.) (And it's also worth noting Atiyah arrived at the conjecture following up on Berry and Robbin's attempt at proving the spin-statistics theorem, which says that half-integer spin particles are antisymmetric under exchange in space (fermions) whereas integer spin particles are symmetric under exchange in space (bosons), without invoking relativistic quantum field theory. The proof hinges on the use of the oscillator representation, using four oscillators to represent two spins, and building X, Y, Z rotation operators that act across the spins, rotating the one into the other.) (At another time, we'll show off some visualizations of what Atiyah is going on about.)"
