    "# What is an atom?\n",
    "\n",
    "I don't mean an atom like on the periodic table, which is really a complicated enough thing of its own \"made of\" electrons, protons, neutrons, and so forth. I mean, an actual atom. The word in Ancient Greek means something indivisible. Sometimes \"atomism\" is characterized as the belief that the world is made of tiny little hard impenetrable pebbles whizzing around in empty space, perhaps, according to Lucretius, swerving from time to time in a pique of will. But in a literal sense, atomism is the idea that the world is in some sense composed of indivisibles. We can divide something up, but at some point we won't be able to divide any longer. And what's left are the atoms. \n",
    "\n",
    "One could interpret this \"materialistically\" that what's left is tiny little bits of \"matter\", perhaps differently shaped, perhaps of different substances, that can fit into each other in different ways. But \"idealistically\", we could interpret this as a reflection on the fact that when we analyze an idea, what we do is we reduce it down to a bunch of basic concepts fitted together into a jigsaw; and the most basic concepts have to be taken for granted, atomically. Of course, an idea can be interpreted in many ways, expressed in different ways as a complex of perhaps different basic concepts. So that from one point of view, a concept can be resolved into these atoms; whereas from another point of view, the concept can be resolved into some other notion of atoms. We prove our understanding to each other by demonstrating how we can reduce some shared concept into some agreed upon atoms. And arguably, what we mean by \"understanding\" is the ability to apprehend what something \"is made of\" immediately upon recognizing it. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth observing that when the materialist wants to have their atoms be tiny little \"physical\" cubes or octahedra, knocking around, naturally selecting, in actual practice, what they really need to do is plausibly reduce *all their concepts* down into a single set of basic atomic concepts, which correspond exactly to the ideas of \"the tiny hard impenetrable sphere,\" \"the tiny little pyramid,\" out in the real world. When put this way, it actually seems rather extravagant. While it is \"obvious\" in some sense that ideas can be analyzed into atomic ideas, it would be really quite something if *all* concepts could be reduced to jigsaws made of exactly the same ideas. It would mean all those inequivalent ways of analyzing concepts were really worthless: after all, why not just use the universal ideas, the universal atoms? \n",
    "\n",
    "The materialist could respond: The real world is made up of one set of atoms; it's only in the mind that we can analyze concepts into seemingly different inequivalent atomic schemes, leading to the disagreement and confusion. The response at this juncture can only be that if you're willing to consider that, why not consider the case where, it's only in the mind that all concepts can be reduced down to a single set of ur-concepts (your own!), whereas in the real world, real things can be reduced down to ur-concepts in different inequivalent ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only way to proceed is to actually try to do it: we have to try to divide the world and our concepts into universal atoms and see what happens.\n",

    "So we begin with an atom. We symbolize it with a pebble: $\\Large\\bullet$.  Tiny, hard, impenetrable. Point-like. You can turn over a real pebble in your hand. Of course, you can split an actual pebble, but maybe you imagine splitting it again and again, and eventually maybe you can't split it any more: and we're talking about that, that ur-pebble at the bottom in the dust, separated from its fellow dust. Or from another point of view, we're tracing the roots of our human concept of a \"pebble\" and what we can do with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we have a pebble: $\\Large\\bullet$. What can we do with it? Well, if we had it, we could lose it, get rid of it, take it away. We'll denote the absence of the pebble with $\\Large\\circ$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For later reasons, I want to call what we just did: homogenization. For now, the terminology isn't important. The point is in our way of representing things, we have a way of symbolizing both a thing and its absence. And indeed, this is how we perceive the situation: the empty space there in your hand is just inviting me to place a pebble in it. To understand the concept of a pebble is to see the world as one giant set of opportunities to place a pebble somewhere where it's absent or to take a pebble from where it sits. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, homogenization is necessary for reliable communication. If we can in fact recognize them, we can use the presence or absence of a pebble to communicate something perhaps totally unrelated to the pebble. A little rock on a ledge by a window, a sign that the riots begin tomorrow. But there's a catch! Just the same, we could have prepared a little surprise, which is that it would be precisely the *absence* of the pebble that would signify the riots begin tomorrow, whereas its presence would have signified regrouping. So it's clear: in order to communicate something with a pebble, we have to both understand pebbles, to be able to pick them out of the background of perception, promoting their presence or absence to the foreground, but also: we have to make an ultimately arbitrary choice about whether presence or absence will significant, which one is $0$ and which one is $1$. The choice is arbitrary, but a choice must be made. And this fact means that if we swap pebbles for absences, we can on the flip side correct our rule for signification by swapping them in the same way, riots for regrouping.\n",

    "So far we've just been really considering a single pebble and what we can do with it. \n",
    "\n",
    "But, if $1$ pebble is sitting there, why not put another one beside it? So now we have $2$ pebbles: $ \\Large \\{ \\Large\\bullet, \\Large\\bullet \\}$. We could add another pebble. Then we'd have $3$ pebbles: $ \\Large \\{ \\Large\\bullet, \\Large\\bullet, \\Large\\bullet \\}$. And, all things being equal, there's no limit to our being able to add more pebbles. And so, we've discovered counting up. And naturally, if we can count up, we can count down, removing pebbles until we're back to our original pebble. \n",
    "\n",
    "One way to look at this is that we're providing more context for our pebble $\\Large\\bullet$. Picture it like our pebble is actually floating in an infinite sea of pebble-absences: $ \\Large \\{\\dots, \\Large\\circ, \\Large\\bullet, \\Large\\circ, \\dots \\}$. Each absence represents an opportunity to add another pebble. You can take the bait: $ \\Large \\{\\dots, \\Large\\circ, \\Large\\bullet, \\Large\\bullet, \\dots \\}$, and again: $ \\Large \\{\\dots, \\Large\\bullet, \\Large\\bullet, \\Large\\bullet, \\dots \\}$, without limit: which implies there's always one more $\\Large\\circ$ left no matter how many $\\Large\\bullet$'s you add, just as you started with a single $\\Large\\bullet$ in a sea of $\\Large\\circ$'s. Of course the order doesn't matter. If before we had atoms, we now have composites made of these atoms, in which the atoms all coexist simultaneously, atop each other, however you want to look at it.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've discovered the counting numbers $1, 2, 3, \\dots$. You could picture them like: a bunch of pebbles in a pile. But notice we start counting at 1. This is necessary because we'd like to preserve the original symmetry, the fact that we could swap a pebble for its absence, as well as our interpretations, and still get a successful signification. In this case, we just flip the colors on all the pebbles. You could imagine it as \"a universe which consists on a single pile of pebbles (or absences).\"\n",

    "Well, naturally we'd be interested in having multiple piles of pebbles to play with.\n",
    "\n",
    "What does it mean to group pebbles into piles? We could imagine bringing the pebbles closer and closer together until actually they're in the \"same place,\" but since that's tricky, we signify grouping instead by drawing a circle around the pebbles, or just kind of making a little stack of them in a pile. The order/placement of the pebbles doesn't matter, just the fact that the pebbles are all in there, and there is some number of them. And just as we can have multiple pebbles in a pile, we can have multiple piles lying around. (Living analogously in a single \"pile of piles\" which provides the background context, just as a single pile provided the background context for a single pebble. But to that we will come in time. For now, we're just thinking about having multiple piles.)\n",
    "\n",
    "What's the most basic thing we could do with piles? Well, we could combine piles. This is called \"addition.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\Large \\{ \\Large\\bullet, \\Large\\bullet \\} + \\Large \\{ \\Large\\bullet, \\Large\\bullet, \\Large\\bullet \\} = \\Large \\{ \\Large\\bullet, \\Large\\bullet, \\Large\\bullet, \\Large\\bullet, \\Large\\bullet \\} $\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, $2 + 3 = 5$. We could think of this like iterated counting up: we count up by as many pebbles are in the pile, \"all at once,\" as opposed to one at a time, and if we think in terms of combining piles obviously: $2 + 3 = 3 + 2 = 5$. But if we want an inverse operation, iterated counting down, where we count down by as many pebbles are in a pile, we suddenly have a problem: what if we subtract past 1 to 0 or what's words \"negative numbers\"? For example, $2 - 3 = -1$:\n",

    "Clearly, we have to introduce a second kind of pebble (with its own kind of absence) to keep track of our \"debts.\" The rule is that if a $\\Large\\bullet$ and a $\\Large{\\color{red} \\bullet}$ are in a pile together, we can remove them both: $\\Large \\{ \\Large\\bullet, \\Large{\\color{red} \\bullet} \\} \\rightarrow \\Large\\{ \\}$. So now we can represent an empty pile, $0$, just a circle with nothing in it. Or with colored pebbles themselves as any pile with an equal number of $\\Large\\bullet$'s and $\\Large{\\color{red} \\bullet}$'s. Black and red pebbles can't coexist in a pile together, and so eventually after all the credits and debts cancel out, the pebbles in a pile are all red, all black, or 0. And so we have a new kind of freedom in our representation: we can add arbitrary pairs of black and red pebbles to any pile and this won't change the number that it represents: $\\Large \\{ \\Large\\bullet, \\Large\\bullet,  \\Large{\\color{red} \\bullet}, \\Large{\\color{red} \\bullet}, \\Large{\\color{red} \\bullet}, \\Large{\\color{red} \\bullet}\\} \\rightarrow \\Large\\{ \\Large{\\color{red} \\bullet}, \\Large{\\color{red} \\bullet} \\}$.\n",

If we think about it \"musically,\" $14$ falls on the beat of $2$ and $7$: as I say, every 2nd number is divisible by $2$, every 7th number is divisible by $7$, and both beats fall on $14$.

    "So suppose we have some polynomial $ f(z) = c_{n}z^n + \\dots + c_{4}z^{4} +  c_{3}z^{3} + c_{2}z^{2} + c_{1}z + c_{0}$. Now suppose that we take $z$ to be very large. For a very large $z$ the difference between $z^{n-1}$ and $z^n$ is considerable, and we can say that the polynomial is dominated by the $c_{n}z^n$ term. Now imagine tracing out a big circle in the complex plane corresponding to different values of $z$. If we look at $f(z)$, it'll similarly wind around a circle $n$ times as fast (with a little wiggling as it does so corresponding to the other tiny terms). Now imagine shrinking the $z$ circle down smaller and smaller until $z=0$. But $f(0) = c_{0}$, which is just the constant term. So as the \"input\" circle shrinks down to 0, the \"output\" circle shrinks down to $c_{0}$. To get there, however, the shrinking circle in the output plane must have passed the origin at some point, and therefore the polynomial has at least one root. You factor that root out of the polynomial leading to a polynomial of one less degree, and repeat the argument, until there are no more roots left. Therefore, a degree $n$ polynomial has exactly $n$ roots in the complex numbers.\n",

You can multiply vectors by scalars, and add them up, and you'll always get a vector in the vector space. Implicitly, we've worked with real vector spaces when we used $(x, y)$ and $(x, y, z)$ coordinates. Here, we're working with complex vector spaces. (Note we could use other \"division algebras\" for our scalars: reals, complex numbers, quaternions, or octonions, but complex numbers give us all we need.) But just like real vector spaces, the point is that we can expand any vector in some \"basis.\" For real 3D vectors, we often use $(1,0,0)$, $(0,1,0)$, and $(0,0,1)$. The idea is that any 3D point can be written as a linear combination of these three vectors, which are orthonormal: they are at right angles, and of unit length. \n",

    "In real vector spaces, the length of a vector is given by $\\sqrt{v \\cdot v}$, where $v \\cdot v$ is the inner product: you multiply the entries of the two vectors pairwise and sum. If you take $u \\cdot v$, this quantity will be 0 if the vectors are at right angles. For complex vector spaces, we use the bracket notation $\\langle v \\mid v \\rangle$, where recall that the $\\langle v \\mid$ is a bra, which is the complex conjugated row vector corresponding to the column vector $\\mid v \\rangle$. \n",

Supposing we've quantized along the Z-axis, then $aa*$ is the probability of measuring this qubit to be $\\uparrow$ along the Z direction, and $bb*$ is the probability of measuring it to be $\\downarrow$.

    "It's worth noting: if the state is an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian, then the constellation doesn't change: there's only a phase evolution. Perturbing the state slightly from that eigenstate will cause the stars to precess around their former locations. Further perturbations will eventually cause the stars to begin to swap places, until eventually it because visually unclear which point they had been precessing around."

Even for the spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ case, what's the use of working with a two dimensional complex vector representation?\n",

    "Suppose we have a bar magnet. It has a North Pole and a South Pole, and it's oriented along some axis. Let's say you shoot it through a magnetic field that's stronger in one direction, so that it gets weaker the more you move up, stronger the more you move down. To the extent that the magnet is aligned with or against the magnetic field, it'll be deflected up or deflected down and tilted a little bit. For a big bar magnet, it seems like it can be deflected any continuous amount, depending on the original orientation of the magnet.\n",

Eventually, we reach the \"atoms\" themselves whose electrons are spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ particles, which means they're spinning, and this generates a little magnetic field: to wit, a spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ particle is like the tiniest possible bar magnet. It turns out that what makes a big bar magnet magnetic is that all of its spins are entangled so that they're all pointing in the same direction, leading to a big magnetic field.\n",

    "Here's the surprising thing. It is deflected up or down by some fixed amount, with a certain probability, and if it is deflected up, then it ends up spinning perfectly aligned with the magnetic field; and if it is deflected down, then it ends up spinning perfectly anti-aligned with the magnetic field.

    "To wit, suppose your magnetic field is oriented along the Z-axis. If you have a spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ state $\\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$ represented in the Z-basis, then the probability that the spin will end up in the $\\mid \\uparrow \\rangle$ state is $aa*$ and the probability that the spin will end up in the $\\mid \\downarrow \\rangle$ state is given by $bb*$.

We'd express the vector $\\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}$ in terms of the eigenstates of the Y operator or the X operator, etc. We'd get another vector $\\begin{pmatrix} c \\\\ d \\end{pmatrix}$ and $cc*$ would be the probability of getting $\\uparrow$ in the Y direction or getting $\\downarrow$ in the Y direction.\n",

Now given a point on the sphere representing spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ particle's spin axis, you project that point perpendicularly onto the measurement axis. This divides that line segment into two pieces. If you imagine that the line is like an elastic band that snaps randomly in some location, and then the two ends are dragged to the two antipodal points, carrying the projected point with it, the projected point will ends up at one or other of the two antipodal locations with a certain probability, which is indeed the correct probability for that experiment. Note that this simple geometric picture only works for spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$; the generalization to higher spin isn't so easily visualizable, but is basically analogous.\n",

So if we're in the Z-basis we have some $\\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\\\ c \\end{pmatrix}$ and the probability of the first outcome is $aa*$, the second outcome is $bb*$, and the third outcome is $cc*$.\n",

    "\n",
    "The idea is that a big bar magnet could be treated as practically a spin-$\\infty$ particle, with an infinite number of stars at the same point. And so, it \"splits into so many beams\" that it seems like it could end up in a whole continuum of possible locations, so it took so many thousands of years before we realized that (spin) angular momentum is actually quantized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a simple version of a Stern-Gerlach set-up. We make some simplifications. We work in 2D. The particle starts to the left and zips along horizontally to the right. The magnetic field/Z direction is up/down. The particle's Z operator couples to its position along the Z axis. And the magnetic field acts on the spin. Finally, we make a finite approximation which is effectively like putting the particle in a box, so after a while it starts reflecting off the edges. In any case, the probability of the particle to be at a given location is visualized as the radius of the sphere shown at that point. Try changing the particles $j$-value, it's initial state, and even the number of lattice spacings!"

    "Okay, so let's take a moment to stop and think.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we wanted to be fancy, we could describe a point on a plane $(x, y)$ as being in a \"superposition\" of $(1,0)$ and $(0,1)$. For example, the point $(1,1)$ which makes a diagonal line from the origin would be an equal superposition of being \"horizontal\" and \"vertical.\" In other words, we can add locations up and the sum of two locations is also a location. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's clear that we can describe a point on the plane in many different ways. We could rotate our coordinate system, use any set of two linearly independent vectors in the plane, and write out coordinates for the same point using many different frames of reference. This doesn't have anything to do with the point. The point is where it is. But we could describe it in many, many different ways as different superpositions of different basis states. Nothing weird about that. They just correspond to \"different perspectives\" on that point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example of superposition, in fact, the ur-example if you will is waves. You drop a rock in the water and the water starts rippling outwards. Okay. You wait until the water is calm again, and then you drop another rock in the water at a nearby location and the water ripples outwards, etc. Now suppose you dropped both rocks in at the same time. How will the water ripple? It's just a simple sum of the first two cases. The resulting ripples will be a  sum of the waves from the one rock and the waves from the other rock. In other words, you can superpose waves, and that just makes another wave. This works for waves in water, sound waves, even light waves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Waves are described by differential equations. And solutions to (homogenous) differential equations have the property that a sum of two solutions is also a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose we have a simple ordinary differential equation $y'' + 2y' + y = 0$. The idea is to find some function $y(x)$ such that the sum of its second derivative plus two times its first derivative plus the function equals 0. Suppose we had such a function. And what if we had another function $z(x)$ such that $z'' + 2z' + z = 0$, in other words, $z(x)$ is also a solution to the differential equation? If we took any linear combination of $y$ and $z$ then that will also be a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "E.g:\n",
    "\n",
    "$y'' + 2y' + y = 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "$z'' + 2z' + z = 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "$(y+z)'' + 2(y+z)' + (y+z) = y'' + z'' + 2y' + 2z' + y + z = (y'' + 2y' + y) + (z'' + 2z' + z) = 0 + 0 = 0 $\n",
    "\n",
    "This works because taking the derivative is a linear operator! So that $(y + z)' = y' + z'$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, we can find a general solution to the different equation using an auxilliary polynomial.\n",
    "\n",
    "$y'' + 2y' + y = 0 \\rightarrow k^{2} + 2k + 1 = 0 \\rightarrow (k + 1)(k + 1) = 0 \\rightarrow k = \\{-1,-1\\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "So that the general solution is $y = c_{0}e^{-x} + c_{1}xe^{-x}$. It doesn't matter the whole theory of how I solved this equation. You can confirm that it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "$y' = -c_{0}e^{-x} + c_{1}(-xe^{-x} + e^{-x})$\n",

    "\n",
    "The point is that the solutions form a 2D vector space and any solution can be written as a linear combination of $e^{-x}$ and $xe^{-x}$. In other words, I can plug any scalars in for $c_{0}$ and $c_{1}$ and I'll still get a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, we've seen this happen in terms of our constellations. We can take any two constellations (with the same number of stars) and add them together, and we always get a third constellation. Moreover, any given constellation can be expressed in a multitude of ways, as a complex linear combination of (linearly independent) constellations.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could take one at the same constellation and express it as a complex linear superposition of X eigenstates, Y eigenstates, or any eigenstates of some Hermitian operator. The nice thing about Hermitian operators is that their eigenvectors are all orthogonal, and so we can use them as a basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the constellation is how it is, but it can be described in different reference frames in different ways, as a superposition of different basis constellations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the daring thing about quantum mechanics is that is says that basically, everything is just like waves. If you have one state of a physical system and another state of a physical system, then if you add them up, you get another state of the physical system. In theory, everything obeys the superposition principle!\n",
    "\n",
    "There is something mysterious about this, but not in the way it's usually framed. Considering a spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ particle, it seems bizarre to say that its quantum state is a linear superposition of being $\\uparrow$ and $\\downarrow$ along the Z axis. But we've seen that it's not bizarre at all! Any point on the sphere can be written as linear superposition of $\\uparrow$ and $\\downarrow$ along some axis! So that you really can imagine that the spin is definitely just spinning around some definite axis, given by a point on the sphere. But when you go to measure it, you pick out a certain special axis: the axis you're measuring along. You can express the point in a sphere as a linear combination of $\\uparrow$ and $\\downarrow$ along that axis, and then $aa*$ and $bb*$ give you the probabilities that you get either the one or the other outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the particle may be spinning totally concretely around some axis, but when you go to measure it, you just get one outcome or the other with a certain probability. You can only reconstruct what that axis must have been before you measured it by preparing lots of such particles in the same state, and measuring them all in order to empirically determine the probabilities. In fact, to nail down the state you have to calculate (given some choice of X, Y and Z) $(\\langle \\psi \\mid X \\mid \\psi \\rangle, \\langle \\psi \\mid Y \\mid \\psi \\rangle, \\langle \\psi \\mid Z \\mid \\psi \\rangle)$, in other words, you have to do the experiement a bunch of times measuring the (identically prepared) particles along three orthogonal axes, and get the proportions of outcomes in each of those cases, weight those probabilities by the eigenvalues of X, Y, Z, and then you'll get the $(x, y, z)$ coordinate of the spin's axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "So yeah, we could just represent our spin-$j$ state as a set of $(x, y, z)$ points on the sphere. But it's better to use the *unitary* representation, as a complex vector, because then we can describe the constellation as a superposition of *outcomes to an experimental situation* where the components of the vector have the interpretation of *probability amplitudes* whose \"squares\" give the probability for that outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, quantum mechanics effects a radical generalization of the idea of a perspective shift or reference frame. We normally think of a reference frame as provided by three orthogonal axis in 3D, say, by my thumb, pointer finger, and middle finger splayed out. In quantum mechanics, the idea is that *an experimental situation* provides a reference frame in the form of a Hermitian operator--an *observable*--whose eigenstates provide \"axes\" along which we can decompose the state of system, even as the correspond to *possible outcomes to the experiment*. The projection of the state on each of these axes gives the probability (amplitude) of that outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's an amazing twist on the positivist idea of describing everything as a black box: some things go in, some things come out, and you look at the probabilities of the outcomes, and anything else one must pass over in silence. And that's all one can hope for. In the spin case, we can see that this works, but with a twist: the spin state is a superposition of \"possible outcomes to the experiment,\" which at first seems metaphysically bizarre, but this superposition can also be interpreted geometrically as: a perfectly concrete constellation on the sphere. (Indeed, you can interpret the \"stars\" in the constellations as little vortices, little tornados, churning the sphere around--more on this momentarily.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, Dirac writes in his Principles of Quantum Mechanics, \"[QM] requires us to assume that ... whenever the system is definitely in one state we can consider it as being partly in each of two or more other states. The original state must be regarded as the result of a kind of superposition of the two or more new states, in a way that cannot be conceived on classical ideas.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, Schrodinger proposed his cat as a kind of reductio ad absurdum to the universal applicability of quantum ideas. He asks us to consider whether a cat can be in a superposition of $\\mid alive \\rangle \\ + \\mid dead \\rangle$. Such a superposition seems quite magical if we're considering a cat. How can a cat be both alive and dead? And yet, the analogous question for a spin isn't mysterious at all. How can a spin be in a superposition of $\\mid \\uparrow \\rangle \\ + \\mid \\downarrow \\rangle$ (in the Z basis)? Easily! It's just pointed in the X+ direction! The analogous thing for a cat would be something like $\\mid alive \\rangle \\ + \\mid dead \\rangle = \\mid sick? \\rangle$--I don't propose that seriously, other than to emphasize that what the superposition principle is saying is that superpositions of states *have to be perfectly good comprehensible states of the system as well*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of a quantum spin, we can see that we can regard the spin's constellation as being perfectly definite, but describable from many different reference frames, different linearly independent sets of constellations. Which reference frame you use is quite irrelevant to the constellation, of course, until you go to measure it, and then the spin ends up in one of the reference states with a certain probability. So the mystery isn't superposition per se; it has something to do with measurement. (You might ask how this plays out in non-spin cases, for example, superpositions of position: I'll return to this issue.)\n",
    "\n",
    "One nice analogy is the idea of a \"forced choice question.\" I show you a picture of a diagonal line and I ask you is it a vertical line or a horizontal line? And you're like it's both! It's equal parts vertical and horizontal! How can I choose? I have as many reasons to choose vertical or horizontal? If the line were inclined a little to the horizontal, then maybe I'd be inclined to say it was horizontal more than vertical, although not by much! But I force you to choose. You have to pick one! What do you do? You have to make a choice, but there is literally no reason for you to choose one or the other, in the sense that you have as many reasons to choose horizontal as to choose vertical. And so, you have to choose randomly. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's the same with the spin. Suppose it's spinning in the X+ direction. And I ask it, Are you up or down along the Z axis? Well, both! In terms of the question, it's equal parts up and down in the Z direction. But the experimental situation forces the particle to give some answer, and it has as many reasons to choose the one or the other, and so it just... picks one at random! In other words, this is the ultimate origin for quantum indeterminism: you've forced a physical system to make a choice, but it has no reason to choose: and so, it just decides for itself. It's like: you ask a stupid question, you get a stupid answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a old folktale from the Middle Ages called Buridan's Ass or the Philosopher's Donkey. The old donkey has been ridden hard by the philosopher all day, and by evening, it's both hungry and thirsty. The philosopher (being, who knows, perhaps in an experimental mindset) lays out a bucket of water and a bucket of oats before the donkey. The donkey is really hungry, so it wants to go for the oats, but it's also really thirsty, so it wants to go for the water. In fact, it's just as hungry as it is thirsty. It has to pick oats or water to dig into first, but it has as many reasons to pick the oats first as the water first, and so it looks back and forth and back and forth, and can't decide, and eventually passes out, steam coming out of its ears.\n",
    "\n",
    "Leibniz articulated something called the Principle of Sufficient Reason, which was once very popular, and it basically said that: everything happens for a reason. The donkey exposes the consequence of this idea. If everything has to happen for a reason, and the donkey has as many reasons to choose the water as the oats, then the donkey can't do anything, since there would be no reason for choosing one over the other. And so, the donkey keels over--for what reason? It had as many reasons to choose the water as the oats.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum mechanics strongly suggests that the Principle of Sufficient Reason is false. Nature, as it were, cuts the Gordian knot of the philosopher. An X+ spin presented with a bucket of $\\uparrow$ and a bucket of $\\downarrow$ doesn't glitch out, even though it has as many reasons to choose the one as the other. Instead: it just fucking picks one, for no reason at all. It decides all on its own without any help from \"reasons.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "If the spin had been in the Z+ state, of course, and we asked $\\uparrow$ or $\\downarrow$ along the Z axis, then it would answer up with certainty, and vice versa for Z-.\n",
    "\n",
    "A further point. A spin in itself can be described in terms of its constellation. This constellation can be described from many points of view, each corresponding to some \"observable,\" some experimental situation, which as it were provides a filter, separating out this outcome from that outcome. We can also think about this in terms of entanglement. In the Stern-Gerlach apparatus, we actually measure the position of the particle, which has become entangled with the spin, so that if the particle is deflected up, it's spin is $\\uparrow$ and if it's deflected down, it's spin is $\\downarrow$. So that even though the particle's constellation is defined intrinsically, regardless of reference frame, the entanglement between the particle's spin and its position provides a reference frame, in that some (arbitrary) basis states of the particle's spin are paired with some (arbitrary) basis states of the particle's position. So that now there is a dependency between the outcomes. If the particle is measured to be here, then it's spin will be $\\uparrow$. If the particle is measured to be there, then it's spin will be $\\downarrow$--and vice versa. (You might wonder how we know that the spin's state at all? Well, if we measure a spin to be $\\uparrow$ along the Z-axis, and then send it through another Stern-Gerlach set-up oriented along the Z-axis, then it'll always deflect up, but if we set it through a X-oriented apparatus, it'll give $\\uparrow$ or $\\downarrow$ with equal probability, etc--and the spin state explains why this is the case, which can't be derived from the position state alone.)\n",
    "\n",
    "So although the reference frame by which we describe something is arbitrary, things can get entangled which pairs basis states of the one with basis states of the other, so that each pairing of basis states now has its own probability, and the pairs are all in superposition, leading to correlations between the outcomes of experiments done on the two things.\n",
    "\n",
    "So that, while in its own terms the spin has its constellation, it interfaces with the world via some decomposition of that constellation into a superposition over \"experimental outcomes\" (which are constellations themselves), which can get entangled with other outcomes of other systems. So that the in itself arbitrary decomposition of the constellation into basis constellations provides the hooks by which the spin becomes correlated with the rest of the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Returning to the pebble. If at first, to communicate with a pebble, we had to agree on whether an absence or a presence was significant, then on where to start counting, and then where 0 was, and then what rational number translated between our different notions of \"1\", and then a complex number to rotate from my axis to your axis, now we need to specify the basis vectors in terms of which we've written our \"polynomial.\" This could mean: the 3D coordinate frame for some $(x, y, z)$ point, but in the general case, the basis vectors are bundled into a Hermitian matrix representing a quantum observable, so that to specify the basis vectors is to: specify which experiment you did. To wit, I do the Stern-Gerlach experiment, and I put a pebble in pile A if I got up, and a pebble in pile B if I got down. In order to successfully communicate to you what I mean by those pebbles, I have to specify: what experiment provided the reference frame for those outcomes, and which eigenvalue/eigenvector pair the pebble corresponds to. Then we can both compute the proportions between the outcomes, and reconstruct the state of the physical system, and we three will all be in agreement about what we're talking about.)"
