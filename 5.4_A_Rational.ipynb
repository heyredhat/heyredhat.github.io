Hold a note at the 12th fret, in other words: divide the string by $2$. You hear a tone with twice the frequency, called an octave higher. \n",

If I hold a note at the 4th fret, I've divided the string into $\\frac{5}{4}$, and so hear a note $\\frac{4}{5}$ lower, which is a major third. And now we have enough notes for a major chord. $\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{2}{3} \\frac{3}{4} \\frac{4}{5}$. We've only used the first three primes $2, 3, 5$ and found the tones most pleasing to harmonize against the base note. Strings whose lengths are related by the simple low integer ratios, when plucked together, harmonize. Divide the string by a more complicated fraction, the more dissonant the resulting note sounds with the base note. And so, Pythagoras developed a theory of music, about which notes to play, which divisions of the string to make: and the idea was that the ratios between the notes would be these simple ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll now go on a slight digression, for the sake of illustration. It's clear that when we hear a musical chord, we can distinguish the notes within it. Just like you can decompose a composite number into its primes, you can decompose a musical chord into its constituent notes. The idea is that there are an array of little bones in your ear, each of different length, and so when a sound wave hits the bones, different bones vibrate sympathetically to the different tones in the sound, which is then translated into neural pulses, etc. What you are doing is something called a Fourier transform. It turns out that any periodic signal can be decomposed into a sum of \"sine waves\" at frequencies $1, 2, 3, \\dots$, each with a certain amplitude or loudness, and possibly phase shifted. \n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the simplest kind of tone is a \"sine wave,\" or an oscillation at a fixed frequency, amplitude, and phase. Frequency tells you which note it is, amplitude tells you how loud it is, and phase tells you at what point in its oscillation, its vibration of the air, did the wave hit your ear. If we want more than one tone, we just add the waves on top of each other, superimposing them. We superimpose the waves, but of course: we hear the notes within it, the frequencies (meaning we have to listen for a certain amount of time to make out the note with certainty). Again, we'll come back to this, including what a \"sine\" is later. (Ps. check out [audio.py](examples/audio.py) to play around with a frequency analyzer!)\n",

One imagines the planets attached by strings. Newton says that $F=ma$ and $F_{gravity} = \\frac{m_{1}m_{2}}{d^{2}}$, so that for the first mass: $\\frac{m_{1}m_{2}}{d^{2}} = m_{1}a_{1}$, or $a_{1} = \\frac{m_{2}}{d^2}$. You get the same acceleration if you either: half the distance (which gives a \"note\" twice as high) or multiply the the mass (or tension) by four. It's just like $f = \\frac{\\sqrt{tension}}{length}$. Acceleration is frequency squared? Of course, Netwon gave other more public arguments: the weakness of gravity can be conceptualized as getting proportioned over the surface area of a sphere ($4\\pi r^{2}$) whose radius is the distance.

    "Here's an observartion. If we consider just the cycles originated by the primes: every $2$, every $3$, every $5$, every $7$, every $11$, every $13$, etc, we notice that each new prime has to fall in the gaps left over in between the cycles of the previous primes. \n",
    "\n",
    "At first the primes come fast, but soon they slow down and get more spaced out. But despite this general observation, the individual location of each prime number, or the spacing in between adjacent primes, is difficult to predict: in the worst case, if you're counting, to know if the next number is prime or not, you have to go back to the beginning and make your $2$-cycles and $3$-cycles and $5$-cycles, and see if the next number falls on the beat of prime, or if there's a gap waiting for a new prime to fill it. Despite the simplicity and regularity of the rhythm of every two, every three, every five, etc, each new prime comes as a suprise, as if by chance. And there's been a great effort extended to quantify the statistical randomness of the primes, centering around a conjecture known as the Riemann Hypothesis. And there's the famous Prime Number Theorem, which says basically that for large $N$, the probability that a random number is prime is about $\\frac{1}{ln(N)}$. \n",

Now it happens that it's way easier to multiply than to decompose into primes, an asymmetry which is the basis of certain crypotographic systems."

    "You may recall that we can represent a line in a plane with an equation $y = mx + b$, where b represents where the line intersects the y-axis, and $m$ is the slope of the line. It's a ratio: $m = \\frac{rise}{run} = \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}$. Suppose the line goes thru the origin. Then our line is just $y = mx$. By choosing different values for $m$, we can explore all the lines through the origin, except for one: what about a completely vertical line? The equation is just $x = 0$. Given just $y = mx$, this would mean that $y = 0$ as well, but we know that's not the case: we want all the points with $x = 0$ where y can be anything at all. What's worse, we look at the slope $\\frac{rise}{run} = \\frac{1}{0}$! So what can we do? \n",

    "In short, we've noted that we can associate every rational number to a line through the origin on a plane except for one: a vertical line. So we add to the rationals one extra number, $\\infty$. In doing so, we form a \"projective space,\" and identify the rational numbers (plus $\\infty$) with lines through the origin in two dimensions. If we put a circle of some size centered at the origin, we notice that every line intersects the circle twice: so the \"rational projective line\" is also just a circle with antipodal points identified: it is the space of ratios, of slopes.\n",

    "Consider that given some random line in the plane $y = mx + b$, our lines through the origin will each intersect that line in one place, all except for one: the line through the origin parallel to it. We say *that* line intersects our given line \"at $\\infty$\", and the missing intersection point lives there. Parallel lines are just lines that intersect at infinity in a projective space! You can think of it like: it turns out the two lines are just part of one really big circle. "
