So imagine when a number hits 1, it just bounces like this waiting for the other three numbers to hit 1. And when they've all hit 1 at least once, we move on to the next number N+1.

Then, once we have integers, we have to agree on where $0$ is, and if we should consider the number to be positive or negative. Then, once we have the rational numbers, we have to agree on what is $1$, and we need a rational number to translate between our different units. But now at this stage, we need to agree on *the angle between our axes*. And that's just what a complex number can do. It can take a diagonal line, which has to be represented with an \"unwritable\" $\\sqrt 2$, for example, and can translate it into \"our reference frame\" by multipling by $e^{-i\\frac{\\pi}{4}}$, which by a rotation aligns the diagonal line at $45^{\\circ}$ with the real axis.
