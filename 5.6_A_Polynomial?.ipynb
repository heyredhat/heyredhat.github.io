If we look at $f(z)$, it'll similarly wind around a circle $n$ times as fast (with a little wiggling as it does so corresponding to the other tiny terms).

So as the \"input\" circle shrinks down to 0, the \"output\" circle shrinks down to $c_{0}$. To get there, however, the shrinking circle in the output plane must have passed the origin at some point, and therefore the polynomial has at least one root. You factor that root out of the polynomial leading to a polynomial of one less degree, and repeat the argument, until there are no more roots left.

    "But: recall that a rational function is defined by its poles and roots. We could imagine Mobius transforming these roots and poles, which takes them each to another set of roots and poles uniquely. Since a Mobius transformation maps each point on the sphere to a unique point on the sphere, it follows that a Mobius transformation also maps each unique rational function to a unique rational function. So the Mobius transformations are the \"automorphism group\" of the rational functions, the group of transformations from the rational functions to themselves. \n",
