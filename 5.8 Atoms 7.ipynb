So our complex 2D vector corresponds to a direction in 3D, a length, and a phase. It can therefore represent a classical spinning object: the direction being the axis of rotation, the length being the speed of rotation, and the phase being how far it's turned around the axis at a given moment. It could also represent an incoming classical photon, which is specified by a 3D direction, with a certain color (length), and polarization (phase). Generally, unnormalized 2D complex vectors are referred to as spinors. \n",

In that case, the rotation axis picked out can only be inferred as a statistical average. Looking ahead: supposing we've quantized along the Z-axis, then $aa^{*}$ is the probability of measuring this qubit to be $\\uparrow$ along the Z direction, and $bb^{*}$ is the probability of measuring it to be $\\downarrow$. Here, \"quantized along the Z-axis\" just means that we take eigenstates of the Pauli Z operator to be our basis states (so that each component of our complex vector weights one of those eigenstates). The point I want to make here is that the normalization condition is necessary for us to be able to interpret $|a|^{2}$ as a probability.\n",

If $\\alpha^{2} + \\beta^{2} = 1$ is a point on a circle, and $\\alpha^{2} + \\beta^{2} + \\gamma^{2} = 1$ is a point on a sphere, then $\\alpha^{2} + \\beta^{2} + \\gamma^{2} + \\delta^{2} = 1$ is a point on a 3-sphere: the 3-sphere lives in four dimensional space, and just as a circle is a 1D space that loops back on itself, so that if you go too far in one direction, you come out in the opposite direction, and the sphere is a 2D space that loops around, you can think of the 3-sphere as a 3D space that if you go forever in one direction, you loop back around. But we also know from the above, that we can break down a point on a 3-sphere as: a point on a 2-sphere, plus a complex phase, a point on the circle. This is known as the \"Hopf fibration.\" The idea is that you can think of the 2-sphere as a \"base space\" with a little \"fiber\" (the phase) living above each point. There's actually 4 of these (non-trivial) fibrations, corresponding to the 4 division algebras. The 1-sphere breaks into 1-sphere with a 0-sphere (just two equidistant points!) at each point (related to the reals). The 3-sphere breaks into the 2-sphere with a 1-sphere at each point (related to the complex numbers). The 7-sphere breaks into a 4-sphere with a 3-sphere living at each point (related to the quaternions). And a 15-sphere breaks into an 8-sphere with a 7-sphere living at each point (related to the octonians). Others can go into more detail (such as John Baez)!

To wit, I do the Stern-Gerlach experiment, and I put a pebble in pile A if I got $\\uparrow$, and a pebble in pile B if I got $\\downarrow$. In order to successfully communicate to you what I mean by those pebbles, I have to specify: what experiment provided the reference frame for those outcomes, and which eigenvalue/eigenvector pair the pebble corresponds to.

So all the different Hermitian matrices correspond to different ways of evaluating the length of the state vector, which correspond to different physical situations and consequently different interpretations of the state vector. For example, if we use the Hamiltonian of the system as the “metric,” the length of the vector $\\psi$ corresponds to the average energy. If we use the position operator, the length of the vector $\\psi$ corresponds to the average position. And so on for momentum, angular momentum, etc, any operator.

So that even though the particle in itself can be described equally well from any reference frame, the entanglement between the particle's spin and its position provides a particular reference frame, in that an (arbitrary) collection of basis states for the particle's spin have been paired with an (arbitrary) collection of basis states for the particle's position, such that there will now be a dependency between the outcomes to experiments on either of them.

    "\n",
    "It is often said that spin is an intrinsically quantum phenomenon, and this is, of course, correct, and doesn't conflict with the fact that we can describe the motion of the \"stars\" with classical equations. For example, if we regard an electron as a little point-like sphere, then its surface would have to be rotating faster than the speed of light to give the correct spin angular momentum. Furthermore, each particle is associated to a fixed $j$ value, and so always spins at the same speed, even if its direction can change: hence spin is a form of \"intrinsic\" angular momentum. Moreover, in contrast to the usual form of angular momentum (orbital angular momentum), spin angular momentum can take half-integer as well as integer values. One later learns that half-integer spins are associated with fermions (and are antisymmeterized, describing \"matter\"), and integer spins are associated to bosons (and are symmeterized, describing \"forces\"): this is the result of the spin-statistics theorem, and spin comes into play in a big way in the consistency of relativistic quantum field theory, a topic we'll return to later.\n",
    "\n",
    "The half integer spectrum comes from the fact that spin is associated not with the usual group of 3D rotations, but SU(2), its double cover. One effect this has is on the overall complex phase of the spin state. For instance, half spin particles go to the negative of themselves when they're rotated a full 360 degrees. You have to rotate them around twice to get back their original state. Whereas integer spin particles comes back to themselves as expected after a full turn. (And spin-$0$ states looks the same no matter how they're rotated!) There are classical analogies to this, cf. the Dirac plate trick--and here's a helpful image from wikipedia, showing how if even if you attach \"strings\" to an object, it can rotate continuously in 3D without getting tangled.
