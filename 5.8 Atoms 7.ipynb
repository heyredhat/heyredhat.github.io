    "A word on dialectics\n",
    "\n",
    "Our narrative will follow a particular thread: the generalization of the concept of number until it's adequate to describe the numbers which appear in physics. Along the way, we'll develop all the mathematics required to make simple, illustrative models at each stage, and begin to understand the stakes of even such rarefied subjects as quantum field theory and the quantum theory of gravity. A word to the wise: mathematicians might balk at my notion of the \"dialectical unfolding of the concept of number,\" and the resulting philosophy of mathematics and physics that results. Whether the notion can be made precise or not is for me less important that its role in organizing the mathematics into a narrative progression, which is a great aid to understanding and memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of a dialectic goes back to the beginning of written philosophy. One rather famous example of a philosopher who spent a lot of time thinking about dialectics was Hegel. The caricature runs like this: first, you have a thesis. Then, the thesis calls into existence its antithesis. Finally, the thesis and antithesis are overcome by a synthesis, which resolves them together, but which couldn't have been anticipated by mere analysis of the thesis and antithesis, which are by definition irreconcilable. A new cycle begins: the synthesis itself acts as a thesis, bringing forth an antithesis, etc. Hegel famously used this device to try to retell human history as part of the dialetical unfolding of ideas in a cosmic spirit. Marx tried to apply it to social and economic structures. Its reputation has risen and fallen, tracking the motion of various politics. Whether \"the dialectic\" applies to this or that complicated phenomenon is a difficult question to answer, but the mathematics of numbers is one place where the dialectical pattern can be displayed rather cleanly and persuasively.\n",
    "\n",
    "We first establish four dialectical axioms. These are not axioms in the usual sense of formal objects, upon which well defined operations act, from which we can mechanically deduce theorems. Instead, they establish the rules of the dialectic: and unlike a monologue, the results of a dialogue cannot be anticipated beforehand, because of the uncertainty of the other. We'll see in what sense they are like axioms as we go along: they are best explained by using them.\n",

    "Measurement Paradox, as I currently see it\n",
    "\n",
    "Bob measures a spin, and gets UP or DOWN at random.\n",
    "Alice would describe this as: Bob and the spin getting unitarily entangled.\n",
    "Then, Alice measures Bob and the spin separately, and they always agree. So far so good.\n",
    "\n",
    "The paradox is that:\n",
    "    From Alice’s perspective, before she makes her measurement, Bob is in a superposition of “recording UP” and “recording DOWN.” Whereas from Bob’s perspective, Bob recorded UP or DOWN.\n",
    "\n",
    "So in theory, it’s possible that: from Bob’s perspective, Bob recorded UP; but from Alice’s perspective, Bob recorded DOWN (and the spin agrees). \n",
    "\n",
    "We could say:\n",
    "    a) Many Worlds. Sure, Bob records UP from his perspective, and Alice records Bob being DOWN from her perspective. They’ve just ended up in different branches of the multiverse. If Bob had recorded UP from his perspective, and Alice had recorded Bob being UP from her perspective, then they’d be in the same branch of the multiverse. But of course, Alice and Bob would never know if they ended up in the same branch or not, since the spin agrees either way.\n",
    "    b) If Bob had recorded UP, Alice will always get UP when she asks him, even though nominally Bob is in an entangled superposition from her perspective. The only reason she has to describe things this way is to keep track of the entanglement: some auxiliary thing could interact with Bob before Alice’s measurement, so that now there would be a three way entanglement between the auxiliary system, Bob, and the spin, whose correlations Alice could observe. If Bob were in a separable state before Alice’s measurement (from her perspective), then she’d only observe correlation between the auxiliary system and Bob, and not the auxiliary system, Bob, and the spin: which conflicts with experiment. Moreover, there’s no conflict if the entangling operation between Bob and the spin is reversed; this is just Bob “forgetting.” \n",
    "    Further reflection reveals that this situation (Alice having to describe Bob as in a superposition before her measurement) is not really that strange at all; since after all, she has no access to Bob’s inner experience, even if he does (and its definitely recording UP). So that for her, it really is a coin flip. A paradox is only apparent when one tries to describe the physics from an observerless perspective. Whereas it is apparent, that all our experience is relative to an observer, namely us. Interestingly, nothing in physics can predict that we would be us. But once we’ve put in our past observations, the physics can predict our future observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "   There is a desire among some people to have an observerless physics. But the genius of quantum mechanics, at least according to Von Neumann, is that: even as the theory only describes predictions relative to some observer, its physics is invariant under the shifting of the boundary line between the observer and the observed. The temperature of water causes mercury to rise in a thermometer, off which photons scatter, entering your eye, causing neurons to fire, causing other neurons to fire, causing other neurons to fire, until: you can’t trace it back anymore, except to say: I observed. Quantum mechanically, the water, the thermometer, the photons, the neurons, all get entangled. And so, we could imagine the “measurement” (the projection) to have taken place on any of those systems, all the way up to my abstract ego. It doesn’t matter which I choose, since due to the entanglement, they will always agree. But if no perspective is chosen, then nothing definite happens: there is just the superposition of outcomes.\n",
    "    So some perspective must be chosen, but the physics doesn’t depend on the perspective you pick. It’s no different from: to get coordinates, some basis must be chosen, but any basis is as good as any other (all things being equal). If we integrate a function, we have to add a constant term, even though it will disappear again when we take its derivative. A gauge must be chosen for your railroad tracks, and any width its as good as any other, all things being equal; but once you’ve made a choice, you better stick with it so that a given train can rove around the land without issue. We can write down a general solution to some differential equations as a potentially infinite superposition of basis solutions, but we can’t get any predictions until we specify some initial conditions, which determines the constants. We could speak in French, English, German, Japanese and tell the same story; the choice of language is arbitrary, but we have to speak in some language. The choice of the observer in physics is arbitrary, but some choice must be made. And naturally, we try to pick ourselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "   (Now there could be some restrictions on where a “cut” can take place. Here’s one idea I keep tossing around in my head. One could imagine dividing the world into SUBJECT BODY WORLD, all entangled, and we set up the formalism so that projections all take place on the BODY (including clocks if we’re working with timeless QM, and in general, including all the past choices relevant to the moment being considered), and the rule is that only cuts which are permissible are those that lead to SUBJECT and WORLD being in separable states (of course, having been steered appropriately). This is just one spin on the Heisenberg/Von Neumann cut. Is it paradoxical that the SUBJECT could itself split into multiple disconnected pieces? Finally, in this scheme, one is tempted to interpret the quantum states of the SUBJECT, in their own entangled superposition, in terms of perceptual gestalts rather than “superpositions over outcomes” (re: the theory of constellations). And yet: there is a fixed point, which is our gestalt perception of: multiple possibilities unfolding itself.)\n",

    "   Irving’s point.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Any theory of the mind has as its empirical basis a list of correlations: between the body and experience. \n",
    "\n",
    "   I poke your brain with some electricity, and ask you: Did I trigger some perception, like the smell of your mother’s cooking? Or no? I’m going over your brain, poking here and there, to figure out which parts of the brain correspond to what we are actually conscious of. The thing is: I can’t directly observe your experience itself. So I have to ask you: Did my poke do anything or not? And you have to tell me.\n",
    "    Well, you aren’t satisfied with that, so you start monitoring the neurons that control my mouth, and learn to decode what I’m about to say it just before my mouth actually moves. And then you press inward into the brain, trying to predict whether I say yes or no before I actually say it. \n",
    "    Maybe this proves in practice impossible, if for example the signal from the poked neuron bubbles out over the whole brain, and bounces around, and then refocuses itself near the part where I tell my mouth what to do so that it would be practically impossible to actually trace the causation the full yway. Or if for example, the brain is highly entangled, so that the the relevant occurrences are taking place at a deeper level of entanglement (correspondingly larger scale of the brain). And if, whether due to quantum effects or semiclassical effects, any attempt to fully map out the firing of our neurons necessarily alters their firing pattern.\n",
    "    But Irving makes an even more profound point about self-consciousness. \n",
    "    \n",
    "   So we ask you: Tell me if you feel something, yes or no. And then we poke a neuron, and then that neuron fires, and then another neuron fires … and then we hit a fork in the road, if neuron A fires, then … you say yes! but if neuron B fires, then … you say no! We’ve done the experiment many times, and have in fact observed this correlation. Great! So we don’t actually need your personal experience anymore, we just poke you, and if neuron A fires, there was a conscious perception associated to the poke; and if neuron B fires, then there wasn’t.\n",
    "    The issue, however, is: what if we hadn’t asked the question.\n",
    "    We asked you a yes/no question, and this prepared you to be in the mindset of answering that question, monitoring your perceptions for any change, while we poke you. And this has a neural correlate: neuron A fires if yes, neuron B fires if no. And so we  think we don’t need you to introspect anymore, we can just look at your brain and guess: ah, the person associated to this brain will be experiencing this right now.\n",
    "    But if we hadn’t asked the question, and you hadn’t been in that discriminatory mindset, then there would be no neuron A to trace and no neuron B to trace. There would just be you having an experience, and its neural correlates meanwhile in the brain, but there would be no way to tell from looking at the brain whether the poke was experienced consciously or not.\n",
    "    In other words, we can’t get rid of introspection. The ability to assign neuron A to CONSCIOUS and neuron B to UNCONSCIOUS depends on the subject of the experiment themselves asking the question. (It’s possible that not all brains can ask themselves such questions!) If they aren’t asking themselves the question, then there won’t be any neural correlate to CONSCIOUS vs UNCONSCIOUS. And therefore, we can’t just study brains in isolation from the self. And we have to be sensitive to the fact that “asking yourself whether you are having a perception or not” is not the same experience as “having a perception per se.”\n",
    "    Of course, this doesn’t rule out broader analysis, like: generally speaking, when the visual cortex is firing this way, people see this sort of thing. But that’s a prediction. Even if we know about convolutional neural networks, and watch an image being processed layer by layer, and see the same kinds of connectivity and activation in the visual cortex, in the end, it is self-reporting that is the basis for the study of brain/mind correlations. \n",
    "\n",
    "   One might say: well, what calculation is happening when we poke you, and neuron A fires or neuron B fires. Like what computation is that the result of? If we know what computation it was, and its meaning, then we maybe could say: well, since this computes whether the poke was experienced or not, then by understanding its meaning (probably having to do with attention), we could then understand why some things are conscious or not, and then predict that directly from the brain.\n",
    "\n",
    "   But that perhaps jumps the gun. Since it could be that: when we have a perception that we are conscious of, it bounces around, and gets into our rhythm, and induces all sorts of correlations are are good proxies for the thing having been perceived; but that ultimately there is no rule able to be given in the sense of a computation, but only a correlation between body and mind.\n",
    "    \n",
    "   It’s still not clear if actually we are conscious of our entire brains/bodies, only most of it is “folded up” in our perception, in the background, in the white noise, encrypted as it were, and what we are really doing is folding and unfolding, expanding things out, or scrambling them across, so that we are really conscious of our whole selves (even the whole world), but most of it its compressed down into the fringes of our experience, or is perceived as “scaffolding,” like “spacetime.” So that the question isn’t: what parts of our brain are we conscious of and which parts aren’t we conscious of. But the same question as in quantum mechanics: why do we have this perspective, as opposed to any other? And nothing in science offers any answer to that."

    "Decoherence\n",
    "\n",
    "Decoherence is like: you do a double split experiment, and the wave function of the particle goes through both slits and therefore interferes with itself, leading to the classic interference fringes (when you send a bunch of particles one at a time, etc). But then imagine there was a gas of blue particles and a gas of red particles hanging by slit A and B respectively. The particle interacts with the blue particles if it goes through slit A, entangling with them, and interacts with the red particles if it goes through slit B, entangling with them. Before, the states “went through A” and “went through B” weren’t orthogonal: hence the interference. But almost all vectors in high dimensional space are orthogonal, so that the states “went through A and got entangled with the blue gas” and “went through B and got entangled with the red gas” are almost certainly orthogonal, so they don’t interfere, and the interference fringes disappear, and it’s just as if: the particle went through either slit A or B, but not both.\n",
