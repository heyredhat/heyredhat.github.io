This provides a clue for how to *quantize* polyhedra and obtain the quantum polyhedron, which we can regard as an \"atom of space\". In fact, we've already done it, we just didn't realize what we were doing!\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea is this. We quantize each spinor, representing a polyhedral face, as a spin-$j$ particle. The $J^{2}$ operator $J^{2} = X^{2} + Y^{2} + Z^{2}$ becomes the *area* operator (squared) of the face. We then consider the tensor product of the $n$ spin-$j$ particles representing the $n$ faces. We form the total spin operator $J_{total}^{2} = (\\sum_{i} X_{i})^{2} + (\\sum_{i} Y_{i})^{2} + (\\sum_{i} Z_{i})^{2}$, and demand that our states live in the angular momentum $0$ eigenspace. This constraint is the quantum equivalent of the closure constraint, as we will see.\n",

In general, this subspace will be larger (or smaller), but we could always use a nominal spin-$j$ particle to parameterize the angular momentum 0 subspace of the tensor product. Depending on the $j$ values of the tensored spins, there may not even be an angular momentum 0 subspace at all: and so these spins can't form the faces of a quantum polyhedron.\n",

We constrain ourselves to work only in the spin-$0$ subspace of the tensor product, and so depending on the dimensionality $d$ we can represent this as a \"qudit\" of $d$ dimensions. We construct the inner product operators out of all the $X_{i}$'s, $Y_{i}$'s, and $Z_{i}$'s, and given some polyhedron state $\\mid \\pi \\rangle$, we form the matrix of the expectation values on all these operators. We then recover the face vectors using the singular value decomposition. At last, using Minkowski's Theorem, we can construct a polyhedron out of these statistical averages. Because we're stuck in the spin-$0$ subspace, the face vectors will always form a (possibly degenerate) closed polyhedron.\n",

We can use this same operator to upgrade operators that act on $\\mid q \\rangle$ to operators that act on $\\mid \\pi \\rangle$: $O_{big} = SO_{tiny}S^{\\dagger}$, and downgrade operators that act on $\\mid \\pi \\rangle$ to operators that act on $\\mid q \\rangle$: $O_{tiny} = S^{\\dagger}O_{big}S$.

Lest this worry you, this doesn't effect the expectation values in any way, and if you downgrade one of these operators and upgrade it back, the resulting operator commutes with the original operator. \n",

You can also measure one of the operators, for example: \t`p.measure(p.INNER_PRODUCTS[0][1], tiny=False)`. Operators are assumed to act on the tensor product, and are automatically downgraded to act on the qudit. If you already have a \"tiny\" operator, set `tiny=True`. If the polyhedron is degenerate, or if something otherwise goes wrong, the underlying vectors will be displayed instead of the polyhedron. Finally, you'll notice that the polyhedron glitches out from time to time: this is because the polyhedron is only defined up to 3D rotation, and so when we recover the polyhedron at each time step, we might end up with a arbitrarily rotated version. It would be nice to easily calculate the 3D rotation that will make sure to align the orientation of the polyhedron over time, but it's a little tricky!\n",

This is just the state of a classical spinning object, but it is built out of statistical averages. The really quantum part comes in when we go to measure the spin: the X, Y, Z operators don't commute, and so if we collapse to an X eigenstate, this will lead to uncertainty in Y and Z: we'll end up in a superposition of Y or Z eigenstates. So that choosing to measure along X, Y, or Z precludes us from knowing the spin in the other directions. Nevertheless, being in an X eigenstate, with uncertainty in Y and Z, corresponds to: yet another classical state of the spinning object, this time with its rotation axis pointing along the X direction.

    "Let's reflect a little on what we've learned. We've developed yet another interpretation of the mathematics of spin. We can interpret a tensor product of spins constrained to live in the spin-$0$ eigenspace as an interaction vertex that conserves angular momentum. We could imagine a whole network of such vertices, connected by edges representing incoming/outgoing spins, and so representing an entire history of interactions. Such a network is called a \"tensor network,\" and in this specific case, a \"spin network.\" A closed tensor network, with no \"dangling indices,\" evaluates to a scalar: a probability amplitude for that particular history of interaction. \n",
    "\n",
    "We discovered, moreover, that these interaction vertices could be interpreted geometrically as \"quantum polyhedra,\" the conservation law for angular momentum corresponding to the closure of the polyhedron. In other words, we can interpret these \"sites of interaction\" as chunks, as atoms, of space itself. Philosophically, this is quite nice: since what is space but a theater for interaction? \n",
    "\n",
    "This idea lies at the basis of \"loop quantum gravity,\" a theory of the quantum gravitational field. The idea, in essence, is that the basis states of \"quantum space\" are given by spin networks, graphs with edges labled by spins and vertices given by closed quantum polyhedra.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"loopy\" part is this. Loops are intimately related to curvature: go around a loop in some space and see if when you come back home, you're facing the same direction. In flat space, you always will be. But in curved space (like on the surface of a sphere), this isn't always true. In fact, the curvature can be *defined* in terms of the \"holonomy\" along a path, in other words, the degree to which you don't end up exactly how you started off after going in a loop. This idea is also relevant to more abstract spaces: for example, one can think about the gauge fields of quantum field theory in these terms: as particles move through a gauge field they are transformed under the relevant symmetry group (generalizing the case of \"orientation\"), and moreover one can describe the evolution of the field itself in terms of all possible loops, through which flux occurs. There is something satisfying about this: after all, in some sense, every measurement involves a kind of loop: one thing goes off, and another thing stays behind; eventually the first thing returns home, and by comparing the one who went off to the one who stayed behind, one can try to reconstruct what's going on out in the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, if you wanted a theory of space that is diffeomorphism invariant, that doesn't require any embedding into some higher space, it would make sense to start with loops: you could imagine the fabric of spacetime like a mesh of chain mail, the interlocking of the loops signifying connectivity: at least that was the original inspiration. In terms of gravity, you can think of the loops like being gravitational field lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose some surface. For example, draw an arbitrary sphere in amongst the loops: an intersection of a loop with the surface imparts to the surface a quantum of area: and these are our polyhedra. So we are interpreting the spins in the theory as carrying excitations of area: and no matter what surface we choose, we'll always get a closed polyhedron due to the conservation law. In the limit of many, many faces of all types: we could imagine a large \"quantum sphere\" emerging.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also consider atoms of \"spacetime.\" We generalize the idea of a spin network to a spin foam. The idea is: we fix a spin-networks representing the boundary of the spacetime: for example, a spin network representing space in the past and a spin network representing space in the future. The question is: what is the amplitude for the one space to evolve into the other? We have to sum over all possible intermediate spin-networks that meet the boundary conditions.\n",

    "The simplest possible case: consider the pentagram.\n",

    "Imagine that at each vertex lives a quantum tetrahedron, and each of the four faces of any one tetrahedron is glued to one face on each of the four other tetrahedra. This forms a closed network, and serves as a quantum version of a \"3-sphere\": you can move from tetrahedron to tetrahedron and you'll always come back to where you began since each tetrahedron is bounded by the four others. You can also think of it like a spin-foam: the amplitude can be interpreted as the probability that one of the tetrahedra will evolve into one of the other ones, those two acting as boundary states, with the rest being treated as an intermediate spacetime process in the middle.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's the basic idea. There is much more one can say about the successes and difficulties of LQG, but experts can tell the story better than I. The picture makes some intuitive sense, however: just as gravity is self-interacting, polyhedra are both sites of interaction and themselves quantum states: they can interact among themselves, leading to entanglement, which leads to correlations in spatial geometry; and the geometry can itself interact with matter, becoming entangled with it, so that the state of the matter will become correlated with the areas and angles of the space it has explored. It is an interesting question how exactly different kinds of matter should be coupled in, how to recover the notion of a path through space that a particle takes, and in general, what are the large-scale dynamics of LQG, which ideally should reproduce general relativity in the limit. Moreover, since quantum gravity is hard to probe directly, many hope by studying the asymptotics of the theory, one can predict novel large scale features of universe, and so find confirmation from astronomy.\n"

    "A word on classical geometry. Given a space, say, a 3D space, one can triangulate it via polyhedra: all these polyhedra will fit snugly against each other, their faces normals being opposite, their areas the same, their shapes identical. Even classically, we can imagine relaxing some of these criteria. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, what if we allowed two glued faces to have different shapes, but still demanded they had the same area? It's a little difficult to picture, but not so bad--at least the adjoining faces are stuck back to back with each other. But we could go further, and also allow the glued faces to have inconsistent orientations. This is known as a \"twisted geometry,\" and is the \"classical version\" of a spin network: faces can be twisted and weirdly oriented, yet still glued together: the one demand is that the areas have to be the same. While you can't picture this per se from outside, you can understand it in terms of the transformations experienced by someone inside the geometry. Insofar as as two faces *aren't* back to back, a state passing from one polyhedron to another through that face is *rotated*. In other words, if you were flying around inside a twisted geometry, you wouldn't notice the surrealness of the gluing: instead, you would experience it as extra rotations as you move from place to place.\n"

    "Finally, suppose we wanted to consider quantizing some arbitrary polyhedron. There's a difficulty with the representation above, which is that each face has one fixed $j$ value which doesn't change. Given some arbitrary classical polyhedron, who knows what conjuction of spins will match the areas? But it would be nice to have a way of quantizing arbitary polyhedra directly. \n",
    "\n",
    "Looking ahead, we'll find that the states of two quantum harmonic oscillators can be used to represent a quantum spin with a variable $j$ value: in other words, we can treat the two oscillators as being in general a superposition of spins with all possible $j$'s. We can employ this representation for our polyhedra: each edge, instead of carrying a specific spin-$j$, now carries two harmonic oscillators, and each interaction vertex consists of $2n$ oscillators. We can then quantize a more or less arbitrary classical polyhedron without worrying about which exact spins to use for areas. And our unitary evolution explores the space of polyhedra where the area of the faces can change! Check out <a href=\"examples/osc_quantum_polyhedron.py\">osc_quantum_polyhedron.py</a>. It also turns out that this representation is particularly useful when it comes to constructing the \"holonomy operators,\" which are associated to loops, act across vertices, and whose eigenvalues diagnose curvature.\n",
