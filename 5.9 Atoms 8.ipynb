In the latter case, we can swap any of the symmeterized qubits and this doesn't change the constellation.

Indeed, if we then rotate the rest of the qubits in exactly the same, we can recover our original constellation (just rotated around the X-axis)! In other words, the constellation isn't ultimately affected by local rotations of the qubits: we can rotate all the qubits separately locally, but the constellation is still in there somewhere--there will always be a way to undo all those changes and recover the constellation by acting locally separately on the qubits. In this sense, the constellation is encoded in the entanglement of the whole and not in the parts.\n",

(In this context, if we do the same auxilliary operation to all the qubits, we can *boost* the constellation: we can implement not just SU(2), but also SL(2,C)). By coordinating our local operations, we can always recover the original constellation by local ops: we can always turn local rotations/boosts into global rotations/boosts by making sure each qubit is rotated in the same way.\n",

    "Alright, so we can calculate this decomposition by just diagonalizing the total spin operator (and making sure the basis states are in the right order!). But here's another way:\n",
    "\n",
    "First we define $\\epsilon = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$: it's just the (unnormalized) antisymmetric state of two spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$'s. Now suppose we have two spins with $j_{1}$ and $j_{2}$, each represented as the symmetrized tensor product of $2j$ spinors. We tensor them together. If we then symmeterize over *all* the spinors, we obtain a spin-($j_{1} + j_{2}$) state. If we started with two separable spins, the resulting constellation is just given by: the constellation of the first spin overlaid with the constellation of the second spin. If we had two spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$'s, this would be the spin-$1$ state. To get the rest of the states, before we symmeterize, we contract $k$ spinors of the first group with $k$ spinors of the second group using the $\\epsilon$. In other words, we contract a spinor from the first group with the first spinor in $\\epsilon$ and a spinor from the second group with the second spinor in $\\epsilon$. Once we've contracted k spinors, we symmeterize the $2(j_{1} + j_{2} - k)$ spinors which are left. By going over all the possible k's, we obtain the Clebsch-Gordan decomposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the normalization of the states is a little tricky so let's ignore that! It's the principle that matters: to get each lower state, we remove a star's worth of angular momentum from each of the two groups: and the use of the $\\epsilon$ imposes angular momentum conservation. (Note because of the permutation symmetry, it doesn't matter which spinors we choose to contract within a group!)"

For each one, we iterate over the possible $m_{1}$ and $m_{2}$ values for $j_{1}$ and $j_{2}$: for each $(j_{1}, j_{2}, j, m_{1}, m_{2}, m)$, we get the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, which weights the state $\\mid j_{1}, m_{1} \\rangle \\mid j_{2}, m_{2}\\rangle$.

    "Now there's so much one could talk about here. One could talk about spin networks, originally developed by Penrose in the 60's. It gets at our issue about reference frames.\n",
    "\n",
    "You imagine a network of spin interactions, with edges labeled by $j$ values consistent with the addition of angular momenta. It turns out you can extract probabilities from a closed network without ever specifying the states per se, just the j values at the interactions--and these probabilities happen to be rational numbers. Penrose's motivation to look for an example of how space can emerge out of interaction. His reasoning was that we can only assign a state to a spin relative to some X, Y, Z axes, which presuppose that a shared 3D space exists. So instead of specifying the $\\mid j, m \\rangle$ state, he just wants to specify the $j$ values. He then wonders what happens when you consider the limit of large networks and high spin $j$'s, and he proves the Spin Geometry Theorem. The idea is this, suppose you have a large network, and in that context, a large $j$ spin. You could imagine it interacts with an additional single spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ particle. Now either the interaction will result in a $j+\\frac{1}{2}$ or a $j-\\frac{1}{2}$ state, depending on the angle between the spins. But we know how to calculate probabilities using the spin network itself! (The rules are interesting and relate to our string diagram language from before, where the role of cup and cap is played by the $\\epsilon$. But we won't go into details here.) So imagine the network where the interaction results in a $j+\\frac{1}{2}$, and get the probability; and then the network where the interaction results in a $j-\\frac{1}{2}$, and get the probability. These two probabilities should relate to the angle between the spin's rotation axes, which we havn't determined at all, and so we work backwards from the probabilities to the angles. Actually one imagines doing this twice to separate out classical uncertainty from quantum uncertainty (see his original paper for details!). Anyway, if you do this \"experiment\" for many spins in your network, it's not clear that the angles so obtained will be consistent with each other. One might find that A and B have this angle between them, and B and C have that angle between them, which in normal 3D space would imply something about A and C's angle; but here this isn't necessarily the case. Penrose, however, shows that in the limit of big networks and high spin-$j$, that the angles between the spins become consistent with each other as if there were all embedded consistently in an emergent 3D geometry. \n",
    "\n",
    "Such ideas have been explored in other forms in loop quantum gravity. Again, we'll save the details for another time, but for example, one can consider the tensor product of a bunch of spins, and demand that they live in the angular momentum 0 subspace. For example, we've seen that the spin-$0$ subspace of 4 spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ particles is 2D (it's just a qubit in disguise!). If you do this, then the spins act like an \"intertwiner,\" an angular momentum preserving interaction vertex, and moreover the spins can be interpreted as the faces of a *quantum polyhedron* living at that vertex, where the $j$ values now refer to the areas of the face. Indeed, it turns out the best way to quantize polyhedra is in terms of Minkowski's theorem, which says that a polyhedron is uniquely specified by the normal vectors to each of its faces, multiplied by their areas, all of which sum to 0 if the polyhedron is closed. But we digress... Another time!\n",
    "\n",
    "(Okay one more thing: I recently learned there's an intimate relationship between quantum spin and Bezier curves, the components of the $\\mid j, m \\rangle$ vector being like the control points of a complexified Bezier curve! What!)"
