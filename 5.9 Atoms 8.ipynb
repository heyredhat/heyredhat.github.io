    "Matrices gave us perspectives on vectors. In the quantum case, each matrix was associated to a certain experimental situation, which provided a basis of outcomes in terms of which we could expand the state vector. We used complex vectors and unitary matrices specifically so that the components of our vectors could be interpreted in terms of probability (amplitudes) for the different outcomes. Each matrix provided a kind of \"metric,\" a different way of assigning weights to outcomes, leading to a statistical expectation value for the \"observable,\" and the relationships between experimental situations were encoded in the algebra of the chosen matrices, which implement the relevant symmetry groups. Despite this probabalistic set up, we found in the spin case a definite geometrical picture associated to the quantum system, the stars on the sphere, even as the very same math could also equally be interpreted in terms of statistics and outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We really only considered the case of a single quantum system, allowed to evolve unitarily under the Schrodinger equation in between our measurements on it. In the spin case, we seemed to explain away the mystery of superposition when we realized that a perfectly definite \"constellation\" can be written as an arbitrary sum of orthogonal basis constellations. Considering the spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ case: while saying \"the spin is in a superposition of being $\\uparrow$ and $\\downarrow$ in the Z direction\" sounds mysterious, it's really no different than saying \"the spin is pointing in the X direction.\" *Any* point on the sphere can be written as a complex linear combination of two antipodal points on the sphere, which fix an axis (corresponding to the external magnetic field in the Stern-Gerlach experiement). The perhaps surprising thing is that the geometry of the situation can be interpreted entirely in terms of probability amplitudes over outcomes to experiments, even as measurements generally disturb the system so that its state can't be passively observed, but has to be reconstructed through repeated measurements on identically prepared systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, in terms of unitary evolution, we found on the one hand, in the spin case, it could be equally well described by classical particles feeling mutually generated forces confined to whiz around the sphere, even as the form of quantum evolution: $e^{iHt}\\mid \\psi \\rangle$ could be interpreted as guaranteeing the truth of certain propositions, that certain measurable quantities would be conserved: for example, expectation values of observables that commute with the Hamiltonian would be conserved, just as the expectation value of the Hamiltonian itself is conserved: since for an isolated system, the energy can neither increase nor decrease.\n",

    "We interpreted measurement itself analogously to a filter, a situation that slices up the situation in a certain way, giving weight to different parts of it. Like: because of the particular orientation of the spin relative to the magnetic field \"only the $\\uparrow$ part\" got through, and this happens with a certain probability related to how much $\\uparrow$ was in the original state. The surprising thing about the experiment is that it hadn't seemed like \"a particle zipping through a magnetic field\" *was a filtering operation at all*. Like what's the filter? There isn't like some grate blocking paths, that only lets particles in certain positions or with certain properties through. But maybe that's what it's like for a spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ guy to go through an inhomogenous magnetic field. Certain aspects of the spin are distinguished ($\\uparrow$ and $\\downarrow$ relative to the field) and their relative weights determine the probabilities that the $\\uparrow$ part or the $\\downarrow$ part get through. Like they're trying to get out of a cave and they have to crawl through a tunnel, and so can only come out head first or feet first. Or just as light can't help but split into many-colored beams when it goes through a prism; when a spin goes through an inhomogenous magnetic field it splits into many-spinned beams. \n",

Finally, we make a finite approximation which is effectively like putting the particle in a box, so after a while it starts reflecting off the edges. In any case, the probability of the particle to be at a given location is visualized as the radius of the sphere shown at that point.

    "Entanglement sets up a correspondence between basis states of one system and basis states of another system. The \"Stern-Gerlach apparatus\" couples the particle's spin and position in such a way that it ends up in something like this state: $\\mid UP \\rangle \\mid \\uparrow \\rangle + \\mid DOWN \\rangle \\mid \\downarrow \\rangle$, where $\\mid UP \\rangle$ is the upper position state and $\\mid DOWN \\rangle$ is the lower position state. This is a state in the *tensor product* of the vector space of the particle's position and the vector space of the particle's spin. We can use it to condition on the results of measurement. We can implement \"measuring the position to be UP\" as projecting the position into the UP state; because of the entanglement, this means only a part of the spin survives, and so the spin is \"steered\" to a certain state: in this case, $\\uparrow$. And conversely for DOWN and $\\downarrow$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then have an interesting choice. We could say, Yeah, when the particle goes through the magnetic field, it filters the spin, and so only an $\\uparrow$ or a $\\downarrow$ part get through with a certain probability. And the field couples the spin to its position, and so when I measure the position to be UP, I can be sure that the spin is $\\uparrow$ (and confirm this by sending the particle through multiple Stern-Gerlachs, etc). \n",
    "\n",
    "But just the same we could say, No, actually the whole spin gets through, and in fact, it ends up \"greater\" than when it went in: the relevant fact is that the spin gets entangled with position. In the tensor product basis, in this case, there are four basis states: $\\mid UP \\uparrow \\rangle, \\mid UP \\downarrow \\rangle, \\mid DOWN \\uparrow \\rangle, \\mid DOWN \\downarrow \\rangle$, and the space of states is any complex linear combination thereof. If the spin started in the X state $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$, it will evolve by the Stern-Gerlach dynamics into: $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\big{(} 1 \\mid UP \\rangle \\mid \\uparrow \\rangle + 1 \\mid DOWN \\rangle \\mid \\downarrow \\rangle\\big{)}$, where the only terms are those in which the spin and the position are correlated, and the amplitudes are just the amplitudes of the original spin. So in this case, we could perhaps say that the spin still has its full, definite constellation, which as we know happens to be able to be described as a superposition of $\\uparrow$ and $\\downarrow$. In other words, the spin itself makes it through the field unscathed. \n",
    "\n",
    "But at the cost of keeping our mental picture of the spin and its constellation intact, we lose something: we now have to regard the particle as being *in two places at once*, leaving the apparatus along the upper path *and* the lower path, leading to a superposition of being in multiple positions at once. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's then only a bit later, when we filter by position that we get a hit here *or* there, and the projection of the position slices off the part of the spin that doesn't agree, and we're left with: UP and $\\uparrow$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Well, we could test it! Why not join the UP path to the DOWN path? Imagine the particle comes out both along the UP path and the DOWN path--well, arrange the obstacle course so that the two \"beams\" are recombined into one, and send it on its way into another Stern-Gerlach. It turns out you'll get the same results as the original particle 100% of the time.\n",

    "So at the cost of imagining that the whole spin gets through, we have to imagine that the spin manifests in two different locations. There was a particle with a certain spin axis; then it simultaneously took two different paths through space, only to rejoin with itself: we can associate the upper and lower paths with the two basis states of the spin and say the spin split into two pieces; or we could imagine, in its own terms, the whole time the spin maintained that same definite constellation, but appeared in two places at once.\n",

What if instead we couple the position to some other quantum system, and then another quantum system, and then another quantum system, and then measure the position of that one?

    "A single particle is shot at a double slit. If you measure where it comes out right at the slits, you find it comes out either one of the slits at random. But if you let the particle continue along, the wave function coming out of the two slits interferes with itself, and so if you later measure the position, there is an interference pattern in the probabilities at each location. In other words, the position state entangled with \"TAKING THE UP PATH\" and the position state entangled with \"TAKING THE DOWN PATH\" aren't orthogonal. Whereas \"TAKING THE UP PATH\" vs \"TAKING THE DOWN PATH\" is a binary choice between two orthogonal states, so that we can project the particle in the \"UP\" state and see where the position state is steered to, and similarly with the \"DOWN\" state: the state is a sum of these two vectors, but the two position states need not be themselves orthogonal. And indeed, in this case, they aren't. And so, there is intereference between them when they are added. If, however, you measure the position right at the slits, and then let it propagate for a bit, and then measure the position: there are no interference fringes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine, however, that there were a gas of blue (B) particles and a gas of red (R) particles hanging by the UP and DOWN slits respectively. The particle interacts with the blue particles if it comes out the top slit, entangling with them, and it interacts with the red particles if it comes out the bottom slit, entangling with them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before, the position states tied to “went up” and “went down” weren’t orthogonal: hence there was interference in their sum. But almost all vectors in high dimensional space are orthogonal, so that the two position states (plus everything else) (associated to \"went up\" and \"went down\") are almost certainly orthogonal. And so, what you find is that there is no interference pattern and it’s just as if: the particle went through either slit A or B, but not both. \n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, with the gas, the resulting steered states are almoth certainly orthogonal, and thus can be added freely without disturbing each other in the tensor product, and so you never obtain a result that would imply that the particle took both paths, which you'd have to show via an interference experiment. Another way of saying this is that the off-diagonal terms of the density matrix go to 0. And so we have to say: the particle either went through gas A or gas B, and continued along one path the whole time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why for large objects the double slit effect isn't noticable: whereas a quantum particle is tiny, zipping along at high speeds, and more or less isolated from interaction, in contrast all sorts of interactions are taking place between a large thing and the outside world, all the air molecules, the hubbub of the world whereby everything is always checking in on everything else, and so the world appears transparently, passively viewable before us:  there's no isolated arena where something can follow out two paths at once undisturbed. \n",
    "\n",
    "But: in theory, suppose you did your R and B gas experiment in isolated circumstances, and also suppose you somehow deferred measuring your particle, and gathered up all the R and B gas after the experiment, and unitarily evolved it with the particle to undo the interaction, and let the particle continue forward as before: it would go back to interfering with itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "But in general circumstances, it's impossible to control all the interactions with the outside world, and carefully reconstruct the broken egg, and so once an interference pattern is gone, it stays gone, and we have to say: the particle passed through the blue gas, and then was correspondingly measured in the up position. But that's precisely: the limitation of my perspective, being unable to gather up all the broken pieces. (Although one wonders in the end if one can assign limits to what biological beings, evolved over millenia from the tiniest organisms to our present size, are capable of in terms of coherent interactions with the world.)\n",
    "\n",
    "And so, even if there is \"decoherence,\" we can't definitely regard the filter as having taken place until we actually do the final measurement, since after all until the actual final registration is made since, there is still the possibility that someone could gather up the gas, and restore the interference, even if decoherence makes that well nigh impossible. Even if things zip off at the speed of light, how do we know that right now someone is finishing building a huge sphere enclosing the solar system, so that everything remains inside, and so is potentially reversible?\n",

For now, what you need to know is that the diagonal entries are the probabilities for $\\uparrow$ and $\\downarrow$.

No matter how strong the decoherence, one can't rule out in principle some clever phenomenon that precisely implements the reverse unitary evolution necessary to recohere. It's only by actually measuring it ourselves that we can definitely say: a definite outcome occured--the buck stops here. Although strangely, after we do, it is perfectly consistent for us to imagine that the definite outcome occured anywhere along the chain of causation.

Moreover, a fact can only defined relative to some observer, some system: in terms of its capabilities to restore coherence, in terms of which measurements it actually does, which systems it is entangled with--and even which other systems have the capacity to make the system forget what it observed, which systems can regard it and the spin it measures as a closed, tunable system. \n",

Nevertheless, it is a fundamental requirement of the scientific viewpoint—the so-called principle of psycho-physical parallelism—that it must be possible so to describe the extra-physical process of subjective perception as if it were in the reality of the physical world; i.e., to assign to its parts equivalent physical processes in the objective environment, in ordinary space. \n",

But this does not alter the fact of their belonging to “the world about us,” the objective environment referred to above.) In a simple example, these concepts might be applied as follows: We wish to measure the temperature. If we want, we can proceed numerically by looking to the mercury column in a thermometer, and then say: “This is the temperature as measured by the thermometer.” But we can carry the process further, and from the properties of mercury (which can be explained in kinetic and molecular terms) we can calculate its heating, expansion, and the resultant length of the mercury column, and then say: “This length is seen by the observer.” Going still further, and taking the light source into consideration, we could find out the reflection of the light quanta on the opaque mercury column, and the path taken by the reflected light quanta into the eye of the observer, their refraction in the eye lens, and the formation of an image on the retina, and then we would say: “This image is registered by the retina of the observer.” And were our physiological knowledge greater than it is today, we could go still further, tracing the chemical reactions which produce the impression of this image on the retina, and in the optic nerve and in the brain, and then in the end say: “These chemical changes of his brain cells are perceived by the observer.” But in any case, no matter how far we proceed—from the thermometer scale, to the mercury, to the retina, or into the brain—at some point we must say: “And this is perceived by the observer.” \n",

In particular, we saw in the four different possibilities considered in the preceding example that the “observer”—in this sense—need not be identified with the body of the actual observer: in one instance we included even the thermometer in it, while in another instance even the eyes and optic nerve were not included. *That this boundary can be pushed arbitrarily far into the interior of the body of the actual observer is the content of the principle of psycho-physical parallelism*. But this does not change the fact that in every account the boundary must be put somewhere if the principle is not to be rendered vacuous; i.e., if a comparison with experience is to be possible. Indeed, experience only makes statements of this type: “An observer has made a certain (subjective) observation,” and never any like this: “A physical quantity has a certain value.”\n",

But as soon such an interaction does occur— i.e., a measurement is made—the theory requires application of process 1 [projection]. This duality is therefore fundamental to the theory. Danger, however, lies in the fact that the principle of psycho-physical parallelism is violated so long as it is not shown that the boundary between the observed system and the observer can be displaced arbitrarily, in the sense given above.\n",

It is to be shown that the boundary can just as well be drawn between I and II+III as between I+II and III. In comparison of the first and second cases of our introductory example, viewed in this light: I was the system to be observed, II the thermometer, and III the light plus the observer. In comparison of the second and third cases, I was the system to be observed plus the thermometer, II was the light plus the eye of the observer, III was the observer, from the retina on. In comparison of the third and fourth cases, I was everything up to the retina of the observer, II was his retina, optic nerve and brain, III was his abstract “ego.” That is, in one case 2 is to be applied to I and 1 to the interaction between I and II+III; in the other case 2 is to be applied to I+II and 1 to the interaction between I+II and III. In both cases, III itself remains outside of the calculation. \n"

But the \"consciousness registration of a difference\" has no place in the physical world per se. For example, if we explained why we registered the fact in a certain way, we would localize that explanation somewhere in the brain, for example: we saw it that way, because that neural system did this as opposed to that. Maybe we seek an even deeper explanation: the answer pushes the chain of causation back a bit further to yet some other physical condition which serves as the explanation for a difference-- and we could imagine it as yet another quantum system maximally entangled with the spin. We could try to add our \"conscious registration of a difference\" to the picture as *yet another* quantum system maximally entangled with the spin: but if we add it into the picture, then we have to regard our consciousness as being in an entangled superposition, when manifestly the very thing we were trying to explain was the appearence of one definite outcome over another consciously. So if we add \"the substrate of our consciousness registration\" to the picture, we, as it were, immedietly have to collapse it, and the rest of the world into a definite state, or else admit that our conscious registration can't be reduced to its substrate and so is \"extra-physical\".

If Bob were already in a separable state before Alice’s measurement (from her perspective), then she’d only observe correlations between the auxiliary system and Bob, and not the auxiliary system, Bob, and the spin.

But the genius of quantum mechanics, at least according to Von Neumann, is that: even as the theory only describes predictions relative to some observer, its physics is invariant under the shifting of the boundary line between the observer and the observed. The temperature of water causes mercury to rise in a thermometer, off which photons scatter, entering your eye, causing neurons to fire, causing other neurons to fire, causing other neurons to fire, until: you can’t trace it back anymore, except to say: I observed. Quantum mechanically, the water, the thermometer, the photons, the neurons, all get entangled. And so, we could imagine the “measurement” (the projection) to have taken place on any of those systems, all the way up to my abstract ego.

A gauge must be chosen for your railroad tracks, and any width its as good as any other, all things being equal; but once you’ve made a choice, you better stick with it so that a given train can rove around the land without issue. We can write down a general solution to some differential equations as a potentially infinite superposition of basis solutions, but we can’t get any predictions until we specify some initial conditions, which determines the constants. We could speak in French, English, German, Japanese and tell the same story; the choice of language is arbitrary, but we have to speak in some language.

Memorably, Plato referred to a human as a kind of symbol: in the sense that we're always looking for our other half.

Indeed, if we then rotate the rest of the qubits in exactly the same, we can recover our original constellation (just rotated around the X-axis)! In other words, the constellation isn't ultimately affected by local rotations of the qubits: we can rotate all the qubits separately locally, but the constellation is still in there somewhere--there will always be a way to undo all those changes and recover the constellation by acting locally separately on the qubits.

Not just because of what happens when we go to measure the spin, but also because we've shown that we can represent the same system in terms of $2j$ entangled qubits, where the constellation is encoded in the *entanglement* between the qubits. (And incidentally, this doesn't exclude the fact that the whole collection of qubits might be entangled with other things; indeed, one can take an entangled spin-$j$ particle and load it into a quantum computer in symmeterized qubit form, and that overall entanglement with the outside world will be preserved, so that one can say: it really is \"the same\" system, and not a copy.) In any case, for the symmeterized qubits, it doesn't make much sense to say that the quantum system *really is* just that classical system, since the quantum system isn't even localized in one place! Nevertheless from the corresponding classical system the entire time evolution of the quantum system can be derived, so that at the very least, they are encoding the same information.

    "Well, we recognize the latter three basis states as just the 3 permutation symmetric states from before! So the last three components in this basis correspond to a spin-$1$ state. The first basis state, in contrast, is the antisymmetric state: there's only one of them, and this corresponds to a spin-$0$ state, a singlet.

It's like finding the \"spectrum\": but instead of a direct sum of \"frequencies\", we get a direct sum of spin sectors. If the \"product/tensor\" basis makes manifest the fact that there are two \"separate\" particles (which might be entangled), the \"Clebsch-Gordan basis\" makes manifest their togetherness. Moreover, it's worth pointing out that a concatenation of Hilbert spaces is also a Hilbert space. The spin-${0}$ sector and the spin-${1}$ sector are each weighted by an amplitude, like: $\\begin{pmatrix} a_{j=0} \\\\ b_{j=1} \\end{pmatrix}$, with $aa^{*} + bb^{*} = 1$. So we can interpret $a$ and $b$ as the probability amplitudes that if two spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$'s come in, depending on their state, they'll combine into either a spin-$0$ or a spin-$1$.\n",

    "Alright, so we can calculate this decomposition by just diagonalizing the total spin operator (and making sure the basis states are in the right order!). But here's another way:\n",
    "\n",
    "First we define $\\epsilon = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$: it's just the (unnormalized) antisymmetric state of two spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$'s. Now suppose we have two spins with $j_{1}$ and $j_{2}$, each represented as the symmetrized tensor product of $2j$ spinors. We tensor them together. If we then symmeterize over *all* the spinors, we obtain a spin-($j_{1} + j_{2}$) state. If we started with two separable spins, the resulting constellation is just given by: the constellation of the first spin overlaid with the constellation of the second spin. If we had two spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$'s, this would be the spin-$1$ state. To get the rest of the states, before we symmeterize, we contract $k$ spinors of the first group with $k$ spinors of the second group using the $\\epsilon$. In other words, we contract a spinor from the first group with the first spinor in $\\epsilon$ and a spinor from the second group with the second spinor in $\\epsilon$. Once we've contracted k spinors, we symmeterize the $2(j_{1} + j_{2} - k)$ spinors which are left. By going over all the possible k's, we obtain the Clebsch-Gordan decomposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the normalization of the states is a little tricky so let's ignore that! It's the principle that matters: to get each lower state, we remove a star's worth of angular momentum from each of the two groups: and the use of the $\\epsilon$ imposes angular momentum conservation. (Note because of the permutation symmetry, it doesn't matter which spinors we choose to contract within a group!)"

For each one, we iterate over the possible $m_{1}$ and $m_{2}$ values for $j_{1}$ and $j_{2}$: for each $(j_{1}, j_{2}, j, m_{1}, m_{2}, m)$, we get the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, which weights the state $\\mid j_{1}, m_{1} \\rangle \\mid j_{2}, m_{2}\\rangle$.

    "Now there's so much one could talk about here. One could talk about spin networks, originally developed by Penrose in the 60's. It gets at our issue about reference frames.\n",

    "You imagine a network of spin interactions, with edges labeled by $j$ values consistent with the addition of angular momenta. It turns out you can extract probabilities from a closed network without ever specifying the states per se, just the j values at the interactions--and these probabilities happen to be rational numbers. Penrose's motivation to look for an example of how space can emerge out of interaction. His reasoning was that we can only assign a state to a spin relative to some X, Y, Z axes, which presuppose that a shared 3D space exists. So instead of specifying the $\\mid j, m \\rangle$ state, he just wants to specify the $j$ values. He then wonders what happens when you consider the limit of large networks and high spin $j$'s, and he proves the Spin Geometry Theorem. The idea is this, suppose you have a large network, and in that context, a large $j$ spin. You could imagine it interacts with an additional single spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ particle. Now either the interaction will result in a $j+\\frac{1}{2}$ or a $j-\\frac{1}{2}$ state, depending on the angle between the spins. But we know how to calculate probabilities using the spin network itself! (The rules are interesting and relate to our string diagram language from before, where the role of cup and cap is played by the $\\epsilon$. But we won't go into details here.) So imagine the network where the interaction results in a $j+\\frac{1}{2}$, and get the probability; and then the network where the interaction results in a $j-\\frac{1}{2}$, and get the probability. These two probabilities should relate to the angle between the spin's rotation axes, which we havn't determined at all, and so we work backwards from the probabilities to the angles. Actually one imagines doing this twice to separate out classical uncertainty from quantum uncertainty (see his original paper for details!). Anyway, if you do this \"experiment\" for many spins in your network, it's not clear that the angles so obtained will be consistent with each other. One might find that A and B have this angle between them, and B and C have that angle between them, which in normal 3D space would imply something about A and C's angle; but here this isn't necessarily the case. Penrose, however, shows that in the limit of big networks and high spin-$j$, that the angles between the spins become consistent with each other as if there were all embedded consistently in an emergent 3D geometry. \n",

    "Such ideas have been explored in other forms in loop quantum gravity. Again, we'll save the details for another time, but for example, one can consider the tensor product of a bunch of spins, and demand that they live in the angular momentum 0 subspace. For example, we've seen that the spin-$0$ subspace of 4 spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ particles is 2D (it's just a qubit in disguise!). If you do this, then the spins act like an \"intertwiner,\" an angular momentum preserving interaction vertex, and moreover the spins can be interpreted as the faces of a *quantum polyhedron* living at that vertex, where the $j$ values now refer to the areas of the face. Indeed, it turns out the best way to quantize polyhedra is in terms of Minkowski's theorem, which says that a polyhedron is uniquely specified by the normal vectors to each of its faces, multiplied by their areas, all of which sum to 0 if the polyhedron is closed. But we digress... Another time!\n",

    "(Okay one more thing: I recently learned there's an intimate relationship between quantum spin and Bezier curves, the components of the $\\mid j, m \\rangle$ vector being like the control points of a complexified Bezier curve! What!)"
