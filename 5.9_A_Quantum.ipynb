    "Once upon a time, we started with a single pebble, and called it an \"atom.\" We graduated to a \"pile of pebbles,\" each pebble within a pile treated as identical, fungible. Even if the actual pebbles we might use to represent a pile are irregular in some respect, what we meant by \"grouping them into a pile\" was that insofar as they were in the pile, the pebbles were to be regarded as \"indistinguishable\" from each other, considered only insofar as they contributed to the \"number of pebbles.\" And so we invented the counting numbers.\n",

    "We then ascended the dialectical ladder, from counting numbers to integers to rationals to complex numbers to polynomials and at last to tensors, the latter corresponding the multiple joint perspectives of entangled quantum systems.\n",

    "We're now going to consider \"piles\" of a yet higher-order sort, piles of identical quantum systems, piles which can keep track of a variable number of  quantum systems, as indistinguishable as the \"1\"'s in a counting number. The mathematical structure we're looking for is essentially that of a \"quantum field,\" although to call it a \"field\" is to emphasize one application of the structure, as we'll see. The general process of moving from ordinary quantum mechanics to a quantum mechanics of a variable number of indistinguishable \"particles\" is called \"second quantization.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "But to understand that, we first need to become familiar with the quantum harmonic oscillator. Then we can discuss perhaps the simplest example of second quantization, the oscillator representation of spin, also known as the \"Jordan-Schwinger\" representation.

We'll see what this means.\n",

The more quanta, the higher the energy. A general state of the oscillator is a superposition of different numbers of quanta. What is a quantum? Here, it's like a nugget of energy. It doesn't have an identity of its own: it's like the idea of a pebble: simple, indistinguishable.\n",

Hence, second quantization. (Later we'll get into the eventual difficulties with this view as regards QFT as a whole.) Note: now we're talking about not a constellation of classical systems, but a constellation of *quantum systems*, as it were.\n",

    "In second quantized quantum mechanics, each oscillator is associated with a basis state of the original quantum system, and each oscillator count the number of particles in the state it is associated with.

For a \"fermionic field,\" there can be at most one particle in a given state, and the particles are always be in the permutation antisymmetric state. In what follows, we'll mainly be considering the bosonic case.\n",

One can add other things to the first quantized state besides \"position,\" like spin, and even make it relativistic. (The difficulty comes in dealing with interactions.)\n",

By construction, we'll get a theory of a variable number of permutation symmetric spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ particles. But we know what a permutation symmetric state of spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$'s is!
