    "So we can decompose the Hilbert space of two quantum harmonic oscillators into a tower of spin-$j$ states. At the very least, the dimensionality works out. We'll see how this is more than just a trick in what follows.\n",

    "Now: we can interpret the two oscillators as providing a second quantization of the spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ Hilbert space: in other words, as a Fock space for a variable number of spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$'s, with any number of such \"particles\" as we like, including superpositions over different number states.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the crucial philosophical point: Quantum mechanics takes seriously the idea that one can only count \"indistinguishable things.\" In other words, indistinguishability is the precondition for countability. Indeed, only indistinguishable things can be counted because they are fungible, exchangeable for each other like pebbles in a pile, $1$'s in a whole number considered as a sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we combine quantum systems we use the tensor product: $H_{A} \\otimes H_{B}$. Now if we tensor two states \n",
    "$A \\otimes B$, in general, this is going to be different from $B \\otimes A$. The order matters. Since, however, we're interested in countability, we want the order *not* to matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classically speaking, the only combined states where the order doesn't matter are just $n$ copies of the same state: e.g., $\\mid \\uparrow \\uparrow \\rangle$ or $\\mid \\downarrow\\downarrow \\rangle$. To say the order doesn't matter is to say: if we permute the order of the two subspaces, we get the same result. \n",
    "\n",
    "But quantum mechanically, we can take sums of tensor states and they also live in the tensor product Hilbert space. This is precisely what makes quantum mechanics special, irriducible to classical mechanics. So we could also consider the state: $\\mid \\uparrow \\downarrow \\rangle + \\mid \\downarrow \\uparrow \\rangle$. This is an entangled state. And if we permute the order of the two subspaces, it remains the same. \n",
    "\n",
    "So in the quantum case, we actually have not two, but *three* permutation invariant states of 2 spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$'s:' $\\mid \\uparrow \\uparrow \\rangle, \\mid \\uparrow \\downarrow \\rangle + \\mid \\downarrow \\uparrow \\rangle, \\mid \\downarrow \\downarrow \\rangle$. And this allows for a much richer structure: indeed, to state the matter somewhat imprecisely, with permutation symmetric states of a spinning object, classically we could only ever pick out a single point on the sphere, but quantum mechanically, we can pick out an arbitrary constellation, and so encode arbitrary quantum states in the entanglement relations between permutation symmetric particles.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we add the permutation antisymmetric state $\\mid \\uparrow \\downarrow \\rangle - \\mid \\downarrow \\uparrow \\rangle$ into the mix, we get a complete basis for $H_{A} \\otimes H_{B}$. \n",

    "On the other hand, thinking in second quantized terms, we have a basis for the permutation invariant subspace of two spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$'s, where their ordering doesn't matter, and so we can imagine them \"jumbled up\" in a pile, and thus be counted. In other words, these are the states with exactly two spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$'s which are indistinguishable with respect to the ordering of the tensor product. \n",

    "This is a map from two *unordered* spinors into the permutation symmetric subspace of two spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$. And we can see, just from inspecting the components, that the vector space is clearly 3 dimensional.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, every permutation symmetric state can be obtained by a choice of $n$ unordered spinors to symmeterize, up to phase. Ultimately the reason is: the fundamental theorem of algebra.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way of seeing this is to consider the two polynomials derived from the two spinors: \n",
    "\n",
    "$f(z) = az - b$ and $g(z) = cz - d$. \n",

    "Let's multiply them together: \n",

    "This polynomial has two roots at $\\frac{b}{a}$ and $\\frac{d}{c}$.  This is why the bijection is between unordered spinors up to phase, since we only remember the ratios between the components. These ratios, considered as roots of a polynomial, by the fundamental theorem of algebra, uniquely pick out an ordered sequence of  coefficients. Specifically, these polynomials lie in a three dimensional vector space, which can be bijected onto the four dimensional vector space of the tensor product of two spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$, and which will lie in the permutation symmetric subspace. Indeed, to take the permutation symmetric tensor product is as much to: multiply two polynomials *in the same variable* and follow the laws of algebra. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth mentioning an interesting fact here about \"symmetric polynomials,\" involving ring theory. \"Symmetric polynomials\" are polynomials such that $f(a, b, c) = f(c, b, a) = f(b, a, c) = f(c, a, b) = f(a, c, b) = f(b, c, a) $. In other words, interchanging the roles of the unknowns has no effect on such a function: it's symmetric with regard to its arguments. (We could think of $f(a, b, c)$ like a permutation symmetric tensor product.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, suppose we had a single variable polynomial with three roots $\\alpha = \\{a, b, c \\}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$f(z) = (z-a)(z-b)(z-c) = z^{3} - (a + b + c)z^{2} + (ab + ac + bc)z - abc = c_{3}z^{3} + c_{2}z^{2} + c_{1}z + c_{0}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$c_{3} = 1 \\\\ -c_{2} = (a + b + c) \\\\ c_{1} = ab + ac + bc \\\\ -c_{0} = abc$\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, if $n_{r}$ is the number of roots:\n",
    "\n",
    "$(-1)^{n_{r}-n} c_{n} = \\sum \\prod_{n_{r}-n}  \\alpha$\n",
    "\n",
    "What this means is: aside from the powers of $-1$, the coefficients of a polynomial are given by the sums of the roots multiplied none at a time, one at a time, two at a time, three at a time. These are Vieta's formulas. (By the way, recall we have $n_{r}$ roots, and so for each polynomial there will be $\\begin{pmatrix} n_{r} \\\\ n_{r}-n\\end{pmatrix}$ terms in each equation. Clearly the binomial coefficient in Majorana's formula essentially normalizes each coefficient proportional to the number of terms that contribute to it.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now consider these coefficients $c_{n}$ as themselves polynomials *with the roots as unknowns*. Obviously, they will be symmetric polynomials. (And let's ignore the $-1$'s for now: you'll see they are immaterial to our point here.)\n",

    "$c_{3}(a, b, c) = 1 \\\\ c_{2}(a, b, c) = a + b + c \\\\ c_{1}(a, b, c) = ab + ac + bc \\\\ c_{0}(a, b, c) = abc$\n",
    "\n",
    "It's also clear that sums of these symmetric polynomials will themselves be symmetric, and so linear combinations of them will be so as well. What isn't necessarily as obvious is that these symmetric polynomials are \"elementary symmetric polynomials.\" What this means is that *any* symmetric polynomial in three unknowns can be written *as a polynomial expression in these elementary symmetric polynomials* (excluding $1$). This involves ring theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, back to the main theme.\n",
    "\n",
    "So: we can specify the symmeterized product in terms of location of the two points on the complex plane (or $\\infty$), which are formed from the ratios of the spinors. Moreover, these ratios can be interpreted as roots of a polynomial, and these polynomials form a three dimensional vector space. And so, additionally, we can interpret this space as the 3D space of a spin-$1$ particle. We recall our Majorana formula, where $a_{i}$ is the $i^{th}$ component of the $\\mid j, m\\rangle$ vector, and the normalization of terms basically comes from Vieta's formulas relating the roots of a polynomial to its coefficients: \n",
    "\n",
    "$p(z) = \\sum_{m=-j}^{m=j} (-1)^{j+m} \\sqrt{\\frac{(2j)!}{(j-m)!(j+m)!}} a_{j+m} z^{j-m}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using it in reverse,  we get: $\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{ac}{ (-1)^{0}\\sqrt{\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}}} \\\\ \\frac{-(ad + bc)}{(-1)^{1}\\sqrt{\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}}} \\\\ \\frac{bd}{(-1)^{2}\\sqrt{\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix}}} \\end{pmatrix}$ or $\\begin{pmatrix} ac \\\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(ad + bc) \\\\ bd \\end{pmatrix}$. This is a spin-$1$ state.\n",
    "\n",
    "So clearly, we can interpret a permutation symmetric state of $n$ spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ particles as a constellation of $n$ points on the Riemann sphere, which pick out, up to phase, a spin-$\\frac{n}{2}$ state. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why the sphere? Recall that in order to deal with a spinor like $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$, which has no roots as a polynomial (since $f(z) = -1 \\neq 0$), we have to add one extra point to the complex plane, a point at infinity, which turns the plane into the sphere. We could have alternatively begun with homogenous polynomials$f(w,z) = az - bw$ and $g(w, z) = cz - dw$, whose roots coincide with the single variable polynomial up to a choice of w (e.g., $w=1$), but which allow for a root at $h(0, 1)$ if, for example, $h(w, z)=w$. This leads directly to the second quantized picture, interpreting $z$ and $w$ as the creation operators of the two harmonic oscillators.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize: suppose we had a constellation of $n$ points on the sphere, and we wanted to rotate $\\theta$ radians around the $x$ axis. We could:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Draw the points on an actual sphere, and do the rotation ourselves.\n",
    "* We could act on $(x, y, z)$ coordinates with a  $3$ x $3$ real $SO(3)$ matrix. This would be the obvious thing to do. \n",
    "* We could stereographically project the points on the sphere to the complex plane $\\mathbb{C} + \\infty$ and use a certain Mobius transformation: $f(z) = \\frac{az+b}{cz+d}$, remembering the rules about dealing with $\\infty$.\n",
    "* We could create spinors $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ z\\end{pmatrix}$ or $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$if $z=\\infty$ such that the ratio between the components is $z$ the streographic projection of $(x, y, z)$.

At the same time, we can interpret the resulting second quantized theory as a superposition of a whole tower of different representations with different numbers of particles: and what is counted is precisely the number of $0$'s in these representations, in other words: the number of *forbidden* classical states. A set of constellations of forbidden states is equivalent to all the magic of the permutation symmetric tensor product by the laws of algebra.\n",

This picture is dual to: for particles to be countable in quantum mechanics, they must be indistinguishable, unordered with respect to the tensor product. This is philosophically satisfying. If the particles weren't indistinguishable, we couldn't justifiably model them like: unordered pebbles in a pile, indeed, with: numbers. Again, classically, when we combine systems, the only way the systems can be unordered is for them to be in exactly the same state. But because of the possibility of entangled superpositions in the quantum mechanical tensor product, the countable states are much more interesting--for example $\\mid \\uparrow \\downarrow \\rangle + \\mid \\downarrow \\uparrow \\rangle$, which is permutation symmetric--and allow for a much richer structure. From this the whole theory of second quantization follows. The vastness of quantum mechanics is practically reduced down to the science of what can be counted simultaneously, which provides context for a pile of pebbles.\n",
