    "One way of seeing this is to consider the two polynomials: \n",

    "This polynomial has two roots at $\\frac{b}{a}$ and $\\frac{d}{c}$.  This is why the bijection is between unordered spinors up to phase, since we only remember the ratios between the components. These ratios, considered as roots of a polynomial, by the fundamental theorem of algebra, uniquely pick out an ordered sequence of  coefficients. Specifically, these polynomials lie in a three dimensional vector space, which can be bijected onto the four dimensional vector space of the permutation symmetric product of the spinors. To take the permutation symmetric tensor product is as much to: multiply two polynomials *in the same variable* and follow the laws of algebra. \n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, we can interpret the symmeterized product as picking out the location of, in this case, two points on the complex plane, which are formed from the ratios of the spinors. Moreover, these ratios can be interpreted as roots of a polynomial, and these polynomials form a three dimensional vector space. And so, additionally, we can interpret this space as the space of a spin-$1$ particle. Using the Majorana formula in reverse,  we get: $\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{ac}{ (-1)^{0}\\sqrt{\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}}} \\\\ \\frac{-(ad + bc)}{(-1)^{1}\\sqrt{\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}}} \\\\ \\frac{bd}{(-1)^{2}\\sqrt{\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix}}} \\end{pmatrix}$ or $\\begin{pmatrix} ac \\\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(ad + bc) \\\\ bd \\end{pmatrix}$. This is a spin-$1$ state.\n",
    "\n",
    "So clearly, we can interpret a permutation symmetric state of $n$ spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ particles as a constellation of $n$ points on the Riemann sphere, which pick out, up to phase, a spin-$\\frac{n}{2}$ state. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why the sphere? Recall that in order to deal with a spinor like $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$, which has no roots as a polynomial, since $f(z) = -1 \\neq 0$, we have to add one extra point to the complex plane, a point at infinity, which turns the plane into the sphere. We could have alternatively begun with homogenous polynomials$f(w,z) = az - bw$ and $g(w, z) = cz - dw$, whose roots coincide with the single variable polynomial up to a choice of w (e.g., $w=1$), but which allow for a root at $h(0, 1)$ if for example $h(w, z)=w$. This leads directly to the second quantized picture, interpreting $z$ and $w$ as the creation operators of the two harmonic oscillators.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose we had a constellation of $n$ points on the sphere, and we wanted to rotate $\\theta$ around the $x$ axis. We could:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Draw the points on an actual sphere, and do the rotation ourselves.\n",
    "* We could act on $(x, y, z)$ coordinates with a  $3$ x $3$ real $SO(3)$ matrix. This would be the obvious thing to do. Maybe instead we work in polar coordinates.\n",
    "* We could stereographically project the points on the sphere to the complex plane $\\mathbb{C} + \\infty$ and use a certain Mobius transformation: $f(z) = \\frac{az+b}{cz+d}$, remembering the rules about dealing with $\\infty$.\n",
    "* We could create spinors $\\begin{pmatrix} z \\\\ 1\\end{pmatrix}$ or $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$if $z=\\infty$ such that the ratio between the components is $z$ the streographic projection of $(x, y, z)$. We could act on these with $U = e^{-iX_{\\frac{1}{2}}\\frac{\\theta}{2}}$ , where $X_{\\frac{1}{2}}$ corresponds to the spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ representation: the Pauli matrix: $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1\\\\1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. This $U$ is just $U = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix}$, the same $a, b, c, d$ in the expression for the Mobius transformation. In other words, we could do $U\\mid \\phi_{0} \\rangle$, $U\\mid \\phi_{1} \\rangle$,$U\\mid \\phi_{2} \\rangle$, in other words transform all the spinors by $U$. If we normalize these, we have $n$ spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ quantum states. \n",

    "  *  In other words, apply: $(U_{0} + U_{1} + U_{2})P(\\phi_{0}, \\phi_{1}, \\phi_{2})$.\n",
    "  * In other other words, we could take the permutation tensor product of the spinors and rotate each of the permutation symmetric spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ tensor pieces equally under $U$.\n",
    "* We could form the polynomial$f(z) = (z-\\alpha)(z-\\beta)(z-\\gamma)$ whose roots are $\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma$, which correspond to the ratios between the components of each of the three spinors, and are the stereographic projections of the ($x, y, z$) points. Normalizing via the Majorana equation, the coefficients can be interpreted as the components of a state in the $\\mid j, m \\rangle$ representation, where $j$ in this case is $\\frac{3}{2}$. We could then form: $V = e^{-iX_{\\frac{3}{2}}\\frac{\\theta}{2}}$, where $X_{\\frac{3}{2}}$ corresponds to the spin-$\\frac{3}{2}$ Pauli: $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} & 0 & 0 \\\\ \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} & 0\\end{pmatrix} $. \n",
    "* Finally, we could upgrade $U$ to $W = \\begin{pmatrix} a_{0}^{\\dagger} & a_{1}^{\\dagger} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a_{0} \\\\ a_{1}\\end{pmatrix}$, which acts on the double quantum harmonic oscillator space, specifically the state obtained by: reinterpreting the spin-$\\frac{3}{2}$ state $\\alpha\\mid \\frac{3}{2}, \\frac{3}{2} \\rangle + \\beta \\mid \\frac{3}{2}, \\frac{1}{2} \\rangle + \\gamma\\mid \\frac{3}{2}, -\\frac{1}{2} \\rangle + \\delta \\mid \\frac{3}{2}, -\\frac{3}{2} \\rangle$ state as $\\alpha\\mid 30 \\rangle + \\beta \\mid 21 \\rangle + \\gamma\\mid 12 \\rangle + \\delta\\mid 03 \\rangle$. \n",
    "  * For example, if we second quantize the $X_{\\frac{1}{2}}$ operator, then the resulting matrix, when properly permuted, is just a block matrix with $X_{0}, X_{\\frac{1}{2}}, X_{1}, \\dots$, the Pauli matrices for each $j$, along the diagonal. In other words, an $X$ rotation of the whole \"field\" of a variable number of spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ particles leads to an $X$ rotation individually on each of the spin-$j$ subspaces. This space can also be interpreted via the position basis as the polarization plane of a light wave.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's do a simple example not involving spin, just for comparison. Suppose we want a second quantize a scalar particle, one which has only a position state, and in fact, it can only be in $3$ possible locations: $\\mid I  \\rangle, \\mid II \\rangle, \\mid III \\rangle$. So we introduce three quantum harmonic oscillators, with annihilation operators $a_{I}, a_{II}, a_{III}$, each acting on each separate piece of the tensor product of the three oscillators. Let's say we cap each one at $d$ excitations. We could list out the basis vectors in terms of the total number $n$ of excitations, and associate them with states in the permutation symmetric tensor product of $n$ position states. It's a map from the tensor product of three oscillator Hilbert spaces $O_{d}$ to a tower of permutation symmetric products of $H_{3}$, the position Hilbert space.\n",

The $\\mid z \\rangle$'s form an overcomplete basis of the Hilbert space of the oscillator, and the complex plane can be interpreted as the position/momentum plane, the phase space of the classical oscillator.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we represent two states as polynomials, we can recover the inner product with an integral over $C$: $\\int_{\\mathbb{C}} f(z)^{*}g(z)e^{-|z|^2} dz$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we note that $a\\mid z \\rangle = z \\mid z \\rangle$, the $z$'s are eigenstates of the annihilation operator, and that on polynomials the annihilation operator is $\\frac{d}{dz}$, the creation operator being multiplication by the variable $z$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's think about the spin coherent states, also some $\\mid z \\rangle$, but where $z$ is in $C + \\infty$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know as a polynomial we should have $f(w) = (w-z)^{n}$. $n$ stars at the point $z$. The derivatives are $f'(w) = n(w-z)^{n-1}$, $f^{\\prime\\prime}(w) = n(n-1)(w-z)^{n-2}$, etc. Notice that the roots stay the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have a polynomial  $f(z) = \\langle \\overline{z} \\mid \\psi \\rangle$ we can interpret the spin lowering operator as $\\frac{d}{dz}$. Acting on a spin coherent state, it removes a root, but leaves the rest the same. In this sense, a spin coherent state is an eigenstate of $\\frac{d}{dz}$, now interpreted as the spin lowering operator, although its degree may change. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we multiply out $f(z) = (z-w)^{3}$ for example we get: $ z^{3} - 3wz^{2} + 3w^{2}z - w^{3}$, which interpreted as a two variable polynomial $f(w,z)$ is homogenous with degree three. The point is that the variable corresponding to the coherent state is treated symmetrically with the variable that corresponds to the actual unknown. When we take $f(z) = \\langle \\overline{z} \\mid \\psi \\rangle $, we end up reproducing our polynomial from before, where the unknown has become the paramter for the coherent state.\n",

And we interpret these basic representations as something like classical phase spaces (as we do in the case of the oscillator (with the position/momentum plane) and the spin (the angular momentum sphere)). At the same time, we can interpret the resulting second quantized theory as a superposition of a whole tower of different representations: and what is counted is the number of $0$'s in these representations, in other words: the number of *forbidden* classical states. A set of constellations of forbidden states is equivalent to all the magic of the permutation symmetric tensor product by the laws of algebra.\n",
    "\n",
    "You could say: what is countable in quantum mechanics is the number of classical states forbidden together. This picture is dual to: for particles to be countable in quantum mechanics, they must be indistinguishable, unordered with respect to the tensor product. This is philosophically satisfying: otherwise we wouldn't know they were the same, and so couldn't justifiably model them like: pebbles in a pile: a sum. Again, classically, when we combine systems, the only way the systems to be unordered is for them to be in exactly the same state. But because of the possibility of entangled superpositions in the quantum mechanical tensor product, the countable states are much more interesting: for example $\\mid \\uparrow \\downarrow \\rangle + \\mid \\downarrow \\uparrow \\rangle$, which is permutation symmetric, and from this the whole theory of second quantization follows--the vastness of quantum mechanics reduced down to: the science of what can be counted at the same time, which provides context to a pile of pebbles.\n",

In other words, we can interpret this as an unordered \"pile\" of a harmonic oscillators: for example, we could be in a superposition of representations of $SU(2)$ and $SU(3)$, etc. Evidently, we can think of this like the Hilbert space of the right-moving modes of a quantum string, in string theory. The idea is you can interpret these as states of a massless scalar field theory on a cylindrical spacetime, where the momentum of each particle corresponds to the the different number states of the oscillators: e.g., $\\mid 3, 1, 2\\rangle$ where there is 1 particle with momentum 3, 1 particle with momentum 2, and 1 particle with momentum 3. And if we simply upgrade the number operator from the previous level, we get the Hamiltonian for the massless scalar field on a cylindrical spacetime. If we tensor another copy of this, to get left-moving modes, we have the complete theory, which can be interpreted this as a string evolving in 1-dim spacetime. It's quite clear that in an almost trivial sense, string theory works: we have a whole pile of oscillators to play with, and we can use them to represent tons of symmetry groups using our tricks.\n",
