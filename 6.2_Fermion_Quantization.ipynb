    "So far we've essentially discussed \"bosonic\" second quantization in which we assign a harmonic oscillator to each degree of freedom of some single particle Hilbert space, and the number operator of each oscillator keeps track of how many particles are in *that state*. It works out that this \"Fock space\" corresponds dimensionally to a tower of permutation symmetric tensor products of $0, 1, 2, 3, \\dots$ particles. In other words, the use of harmonic oscillators automatically imposes for us that condition that the second quantized particles be permutation symmetric. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth remember that although the creation and annihilation operators are not hermitian, they can be used as building blocks for hermitian operators. And if we have multiple oscillators, we can just tensor these creation and annihilation operators with identities so they act on the appropriate subspaces. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we have multiple creation and annihilation operators, they should obey the following commutation relations:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ [b_{i}, b_{j}] = [b^{\\dagger}_{i}, b^{\\dagger}_{j}] = 0 $$\n",
    "$$ [b_{i}, b^{\\dagger}_{j}] = \\delta^{i}_{j} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where \\\\( b^{\\dagger} \\\\) is a creation operator, \\\\( b \\\\) is an annihilation operator, and: the commutator is \\\\( [A, B] = AB - BA \\\\). \n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, if we work in finite dimensions, we can cap the maximum number of quanta in a given harmonic oscillator, and get finite dimensional \"creation\" and \"annihilation\" operators, which add and subtract quanta from each oscillator, although they don't satisfy perfectly the correct commutation relations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, so here's the thing:\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to second quantize fermionically, as opposed to bosonically, we have to make some changes. First, our oscillators can only have 0 or 1 excitations. In other words, at maximum only 1 fermion can be in a given state. This is the Pauli exclusion principle at work. The whole thing has to do with the fact while fermions and bosons are both \"indistinguishable\" (with respect to the tensor product) particles, fermions must always in the permutation *antisymmetric* particles, unlike bosons which are permutation *symmetric*. Look what happens if we try to antisymmetrize two identical states via $A, B \\rightarrow A \\otimes B - B \\otimes A$: $\\mid \\uparrow \\rangle \\mid \\uparrow \\rangle - \\mid \\uparrow \\rangle \\mid \\uparrow \\rangle = 0$: we get the zero vector. The Pauli exclusion principle is just a fancy way of saying that fermions, by nature, are permutation antisymmetric particles. If we permute them, then the whole tensor state is multiplied by -1. This just changes the overall phase, and not the probabilities: indeed, they are still indistinguishable particles, despite them all picking up a sign flip when they are swapped in the tensor product.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, in terms of second quantization, it doesn't matter the order in which we create bosons, but it does matter for fermions: \\\\( f^{\\dagger}_{i} f^{\\dagger}_{j} \\mid 0 \\rangle = -f^{\\dagger}_{i} f^{\\dagger}_{j} \\mid 0 \\rangle \\\\), where \\\\( \\mid 0 \\rangle \\\\) is the fermion vacuum aka the state of all oscillators having 0 quanta.\n",
    "\n",
    "The upshot is that the commutation relations between fermions involve the anticommutator \\\\( \\{A, B\\} = AB + BA \\\\), instead of the commutator.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\{f_{i}, f_{j}\\} = \\{f^{\\dagger}_{i}, f^{\\dagger}_{j}\\} = 0 $$\n",
    "$$ \\{f_{i}, f^{\\dagger}_{j}\\} = \\delta^{i}_{j} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, with a trick, it's not hard to construct the right matrix representation for these operators. Indeed, it's kinda nice that the fermion excitations are capped at 1, since we can use $2$ x $2$ matrices for their creation and annihilation operators (aside from tensoring them with identities): we can deal with a nice actually finite dimensional vector space. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose we have 5 fermions. The standard $2$ x $2$ matrices for creation and annihilation operators are just:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f^{\\dagger} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n",
    "$$ f = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "To get 5 annihilation operators with the correct commutation relations, preserving the antisymmetry of the fermions: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f_{0} = f \\otimes I \\otimes I \\otimes I \\otimes I $$\n",
    "$$ f_{1} = Z \\otimes f \\otimes I \\otimes I \\otimes I $$\n",
    "$$ f_{2} = Z \\otimes Z \\otimes f \\otimes I \\otimes I $$\n",
    "$$ f_{3} = Z \\otimes Z \\otimes Z \\otimes f \\otimes I $$\n",
    "$$ f_{4} = Z \\otimes Z \\otimes Z \\otimes Z \\otimes f $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is that there is a \"normal ordering\" for the fermions. When the operators are applied to the vacuum in the descending order, the $Z$'s in \\\\( f_{4} \\\\), don't matter since there are no excitations in those oscillators: we're in the vacuum after all. But when the operators are applied in the reverse order, they pick up a negative sign from the $Z$'s. You can check that this works:\n"

    "Now you might wonder about the following fact:\n",

    "It is often said that bosons are permutation symmetric particles with *half integer spin* and fermions are permutation antisymmetric particles with *integer spin*. This doesn't actually follow from anything we've discussed so far, even though we know quite a lot about spin, and also how to quantize things bosonically and fermionically. What it has to do with is the so-called \"Spin-statistics theorem.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "First, a word about integer vs. half integer spin. This is the first clue. It can be phrased like this: what is the effect of representing rotations with $SU(2)$ acting on spinors instead of $SO(3)$ acting on $(x, y, z)$ vectors? We actually get something extra. $SU(2)$ isn't just identical to the 3D rotation group: in fact, it's the double cover of the 3D rotation group: for each element of the 3D rotation group, there are *two* elements of $SU(2)$. Take a spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ state and rotate it a full turn by exponentiating some Pauli matrix. You'll find that the state actually comes back to itself times $-1$. It'll only come back to itself exactly if you give it another full turn. So you actually have to turn a spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ state $720^{\\circ}$ to make a full \"rotation\": it takes twice has much. Hence, the double cover: there are effectively two copies of the rotation group sitting inside $SU(2)$ so they can keep track of this negative sign. This is true for all half integer spin states: a full turn takes them to the negative of themselves, but the phase will wind around a bunch of times as it gets there. In contrast, integer spin states come back to themselves under a $360^{\\circ}$ rotation (although the phase might wind around a lot for higher states.\n"

    "So already, it sort of might make intuitive sense that half integer particles might have to do with fermions: there's that $-1$! But: what's the relationship between *rotations* and *permutations in the tensor product*? Since after all, we've quantized spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ particles as bosons and everything turned out fine. We can form permutation symmetric states, and swap the particles in them without picking up a $-1$. That only comes in if we were to rotate one of the particles individually, but of course, that would break the permutation symmetry until we've come a full turn, which suggests we can't act on just one boson, but have to act on them all symmetrically. Either way, the full state will pick up a global negative $-1$ due to the rotation, but won't break the permutation symmetry.\n",

Take two objects $A$ and $B$, put them side to side, and swap them. Imagine you were $A$: what would you see? As $B$ circles around you, you start to see $B$'s underside, and then eventually $B$'s far side. In other words, $A$ would see a swap as: half a rotation of $B$, a rotation of $\\pi$ radians. So let's ignore their actual position, and describe things just from $A$ and $B$'s point of view on each other. That leaves us with two things: we want to combine a $180^{\\circ}$ rotation with a swap in the tensor product.\n",

If we watch what happens to the original spins during this $Y$ rotation, after a turn of $\\pi$, the two spins have swapped places in the tensor product. A turn of $2\\pi$ returns them back to where they began. And so, we've unified rotations and permutations.\n",

So that if we do a rotation/swap, half integer spins act like fermions, picking up a sign; but integer spins act like bosons, permuting without picking up a sign. That's hardly a complete proof, but it's suggestive!"

    "We note, interestingly, that if half integer spin fermions are in the antisymmetric state, then the sign flip from the antisymmetric state cancels out the sign flip from the rotation, so that the antisymmetric state is left completely invariant by the swap. Therefore, the antisymmetric state must be an eigenstate of the rotation/swap with eigenvalue 0. In contrast, for integer spins, the symmetric state is also eigenstate of the rotation/swap with eigenvalue 0."
