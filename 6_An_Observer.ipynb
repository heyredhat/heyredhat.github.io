    "Let's recap. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our narrative has followed a particular thread: the generalization of the concept of number until it's adequate to describe the numbers which appear in physics through the unfolding of a \"dialectic\". A word to the wise: mathematicians might balk at my notion of the \"dialectical unfolding of the concept of number,\" and the resulting philosophy of mathematics and physics that results. Whether the notion can be made precise or not is for me less important that its role in organizing the mathematics into a narrative progression, which is a great aid to understanding and memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of a dialectic goes back to the beginning of written philosophy. One rather famous example of a philosopher who spent a lot of time thinking about dialectics was Hegel. The caricature runs like this: first, you have a thesis. Then, the thesis calls into existence its antithesis. Finally, the thesis and antithesis are overcome by a synthesis, which resolves them together, but which couldn't have been anticipated by mere analysis of the thesis and antithesis, which are by definition irreconcilable. A new cycle begins: the synthesis itself acts as a thesis, bringing forth an antithesis, etc. Hegel famously used this device to try to retell human history as part of the dialectical unfolding of ideas in a cosmic spirit. Marx tried to apply it to social and economic structures. Its reputation has risen and fallen, tracking the motion of politics. Whether \"the dialectic\" applies to any particular thing a somewhat vague notion, but the mathematics of numbers is one place where the dialectical pattern can be displayed rather cleanly and persuasively.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a sense, I've established four dialectical axioms. These are not axioms in the usual sense of formal objects, upon which well defined operations act, from which we can mechanically deduce theorems. Instead, they establish the rules of the dialectic: and unlike a monologue, the results of a dialogue cannot be anticipated beforehand. They are best explained by using them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Four Axioms of the Dialectic of Number\n",
    "+ You can do something or not.\n",
    "+ Anything you can do, you can do again.\n",
    "+ Anything you can do, you can undo.\n",
    "+ Anything you can do in sequence, you can do simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can actually be more specific:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ You can make a mark.\n",
    "+ You can make another mark.\n",
    "+ You can erase a mark.\n",
    "+ You can symbolize a sequence of marks with a mark.\n",
    "\n",
    "We began (1) by investigating our most basic idea of a \"pebble.\" We could place a pebble somewhere, and we could take it away. To communicate with a pebble, we had to agree on whether presence or absence would be significant. \n",
    "\n",
    "We then engaged in a mathematical dialectic. We imagined that anything we could do once, we could do again. So we could place another pebble, and another, and another. And make a little pile of indistinguishable pebbles which we could also take away from. And so we invented the counting numbers (2). The rule was that we could repeat an action, but we always had to be able to go backwards too. E.g., to communicate with a counting number, we had to agree on what number we started counting from. We could conceive of this as a contextualization of our original pebble: *this* pebble is actually the 4th pebble, if you've been keeping count, and to keep count is: to build up a little pile. So the pile is a contextualization of the pebble.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then (3), we could imagine repeating \"counting\" itself, counting \"all at once,\" and so we invented addition, or combining piles. We had to have an inverse, and so we invented the negative numbers when it became clear that we had to subtract past 0. And thus, we found the \"integers.\" To communicate with an integer, we have to agree on what is 0, and also which direction we're in, positive or negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then (4), we imagined iterating addition to get multiplication, whose inverse is division. We thus found the rational numbers, or piles of \"prime pebbles.\" We could now yet further contextualize, specifying a rational number which translates between your units and my units, between our different ideas of \"1\". We also noticed that allowing division by 0 wraps the number line into a circle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then (5), we imagined iterating multiplication to get exponentiation, whose inverse is root-taking. We thus discovered the irrational numbers like the $\\sqrt 2$, but also the complex numbers $a + b\\sqrt{-1}$. We could thus rotate between two coordinate axes, turning irrationals into rationals, and back. We saw how at this stage the numbers turned reflexive, leading us to reflect on the general theory of computation and its limitations. We observed that no single set of logical atoms which are powerful enough to axiomatize arithmetic can be both consistent and complete, able to prove all true theorems about itself, and indeed, one such undecidable statement is the consistency of the formal system itself. In other to prove the consistency of such a logical system, one has to move to a larger, more powerful system, adding axioms, which leads to yet other undecidable truths, which can only be decided with yet more axioms. The point being that one can't start from a single set of axioms and rules for inference and imagine a machine trying out every possible rearrangement of symbols and thus proving all possible theorems. And so we proved that conceptually, there can't be a single set of \"master concepts\" from which all concepts can be mechanically derived. Hence, one requires a *dialectical* unfolding of mathematical ideas alongside the purely deductive. And indeed, that's exactly what we've been doing.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you could spend all day thinking about the nature of probability in terms of probability theory and you'd never be able to derive the surprising way that probabilities enter into our theory of physics, and how, when they appear, they are often intimately connected in surprising ways with geometry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then (6), we began by considering an unordered set of complex numbers, which we associated with points on the plane/sphere, and realized we could interpret them as the roots of a polynomial, giving us a yet higher order version of the idea of a \"pile of pebbles\": an *equation*. We developed an interpretation of finite degree polynomials as \"quantum states,\" indeed as the states of spin-$j$ particles. Polynomials brought with them the idea of vector spaces, and we realized that polynomials were only defined up to a set of basis vectors, and that Hermitian matrices, not necessariy commuting, which are observables in quantum mechanics, automatically provide such basis sets via their eigenvectors. And so, to give context to our polynomials, to correctly communicate a quantum state, we had to specify a set of basis polynomials (which themselves provide context for their roots). Linear algebra provides the theory of generalized \"perspective switches,\" and we realized we could generalize our idea of perspective to that of an \"experimental situation,\" by which a state is filtered probablistically into outcome states, which provide a complete basis for the state: re: the Stern-Gerlach apparatus. And we realized the importance, therefore, of unitary representations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Vector spaces, as well, brought with them the idea of the tensor product, and we realized that the symmetric tensor product of $2j$ spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ states gives us a representation of a spin-$j$ state. And this was interesting because it involved entanglement between potentially spatially separate systems. In one of the great twists of all time, entanglement proves that any simple reductionism can't work in science. When particles get entangled, there is more information in the whole than in the parts. For example, in the antisymmetric state, two spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ particles are maximally uncertain with regard to their individual rotation axis, but their entanglement means that they must always point in the opposite direction. So that if one is measured to be $\\uparrow$, the other one must be $\\downarrow$ in any direction. Of course, through repeated experiementation on the two particles, one could precisely determine the quantum state of the whole, that it's in the antisymmetric state. But for each instance of the experiment, there is more information contained in the two particles together, in their \"jointness,\" than can be extracted from the parts. To wit, we found that our constellation was encoded not individually in any of the symmetric spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ particles, but in the entanglement between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "This was foreshadowed in the holistic relationship between the roots of a polynomial and its coefficients. And indeed, there is an interesting twist: even if we have $2j$ disparate permutation symmetric spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$'s, where the entangled whole is greater than the parts, from another point of view the same situation can be described as a simple juxtaposition: a product of roots, constellated on the sphere. \n",
    "\n",
    "We digressed to discuss the theory of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, and the idea that the tensor product of a bunch of spins could be split into separate sectors, turning the AND of the tensor product into the OR of a choice. And so we arrived at the theory of angular momentum conserving interactions with allusions to spin networks, which by the way, can be generalized to other types of interactions that conserve other quantities besides angular momentum. And we realized that angular momentum conserving vertices could be interpreted as the quantum polyhedra of loop quantum gravity.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then discussed the idea of second quantization. We realized that polynomials, generally infinite-degree, also provide a representation of the quantum harmonic oscillator, full of indistinguishable, countable energy quanta. We also realized that just as in the case of spin, we could imagine the quantum state of the oscillator to be a constellation of forbidden classical oscillator states (on the plane). And that quantum mechanics, via coherent state quantization, can perhaps be seen as an extension of classical mechanics that allows for negative definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we imagined introducing a quantum harmonic oscillator to each degree of freedom of a first quantized quantum system and thus \"second quantizing,\" upgrading to a theory of indistinguishable particles. As an example, we introduced two harmonic oscillators, corresponding to the the $\\uparrow$ and $\\downarrow$ states of a spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$, and the total fixed number subspaces of this Hilbert space turned out to correspond to spin-$0$, spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$, spin-$1$, $\\dots$ Hilbert spaces, each of them indeed being a permutation symmetric tensor product of spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$'s.\n",
    "\n",
    "And so we developed a representation capable of expressing a superposition of spins with different $j$ values, which was also a representation of the polarization of light, and in either case was a theory of indistinguishable particles. All known actual particles are of this type, quanta of some quantum field, albeit more complex.  Due to second quantization, we can think about any measurement, in some sense, as being reducible to the measurement of *some* number operator. And so, we've come full circle, able to contextualize our pebbles as counting the number of quanta of some mode of a quantum field. Indeed, we could say that the world is conceptually made of \"pebbles\" insofar as we can use pebbles, appropriately contextualized, to represent it.\n"

    "When one works in relativistic quantum field theory, a basic demand is that the vacuum state (with no particles) is Lorentz invariant. In other words, translated, rotated, boosted observers all agree on the vacuum state, indeed, on the idea of \"what is a particle.\" This theory leads to Wigner's classification scheme. The idea is that what we mean by a \"particle\" anyway is whatever is invariant, or the same, whether we rotate it, whether we translate it, whether we translate by it, whether we see it while moving at top speed, etc. In other words, we define a particle in terms of what we can do that leaves it the same, as something left invariant under the different perspectives we might have on it, in this case, inertial frames. Hence the importance of group theory. (Sidebar: today in the field of neural networks, people are starting to build networks which explictly respect the underlying group structure of some domain, the classic example being learning representations of images that are translation invariant using convolutional neural networks. The idea, of course, being that a neural network should be able to recognize the identity of something even if it's seen askew--and you can really help it along if you make sure its representation is invariant under some group.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we won't go into the subtleties of relativistic quantum field theory here, how it necessarily leads to a theory of multiple particles, how one has to consider infinite numbers of possible interactions between particles, perhaps using Feyman diagrams or harder stuff, how one has to deal with renormalizing such infinities by considering how the different scales of a system relate to each other, how one can then consider the landscape of QFT's organized by scale, and how conformal field theories (which are scale invariant, like the Ising model at the critical temperature) are like landmarks in the space of all QFT's, and many such interesting things, like the simple internal gauge symmetries that lead to the Standard Model. Someday we shall discuss all that, but for now, I want to make a more specific point: *what is one set of particles from one point of view may be another set of particles from another point of view*. In other words, the perspectival interplay doesn't end with the quantum field: rather, even what one regards as space, time and particle is relative to some observer's position.\n",

There, things come in pairs: one always as some kind of \"position\" paired to a \"momentum,\" even if the meanings of these things become somewhat abstract. Hence, a similarity to complex numbers, which have two parts, real and imaginary.
