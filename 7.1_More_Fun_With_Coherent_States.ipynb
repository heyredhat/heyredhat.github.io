    "\n",
    "$\\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\theta cos^{2}(\\theta-\\phi) = 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we can consider when $\\phi(\\theta) = 0$, in other words, the classical angles which are excluded from the quantum state, and define the quantum state in terms of these excluded states. In fact, between $0$ and $2\\pi$, this function will always have two $0$'s at some $\\alpha$ and $\\alpha + \\pi$, in other words, at two opposite points on the circle. And this makes sense, since we're talking about lines at the origin in the plane, which cut the unit circle at two points. "
