    "We've had occasion to discuss \"symplectic\" geometry way back when we discussed the meaning of the complex inner product. The name symplectic is kind of a joke: it's a translation into Greek of the Latin word \"complex.\" Symplectic geometry is related to the phase space of classical mechanics. There, things come in pairs: one always as some kind of \"position\" paired to a \"momentum,\" even if the meanings of these things become somewhat abstract. Hence, a similarity to complex numbers, which have two parts, real and imaginary. And clearly, the relationship between \"symplectic\" and \"complex\" runs deep: we've seen how in the case of the oscillator, we can interpret the complex plane as the position/momentum plane of the classical oscillator!\n",

    "It's easy to generate a random $2n$ x $2n$ symplectic matrix. The dimensions have to be even since we have pairs of $p$'s and $q$'s. First, generate four random real $n$ x $n$ matrices. Then tensor each one respectively with $I, iX, iY, iZ$, where $X, Y, Z$ are the $2$ x $2$ Pauli's and $I$ is the $2$ x $2$ identity. Sum them all up, and then do the $QR$ decomposition into a unitary matrix $Q$ times an upper triangular matrix $R$. $Q$ is the desired symplectic matrix.\n",
