    "\n",
    "Let's consider how this might work in terms of a Wigner's Friend type set-up. Let's consider three spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ states $A$, $B$, and $C$. $A$ is \"Wigner,\" $B$ is his \"friend,\" and $C$ is the spin to be measured, in this case in the state $\\mid \\uparrow \\rangle + \\mid \\downarrow \\rangle$.\n",

    "Let's write down the initial state \"from $A$'s perspective\":\n",

    "\n",
    "Then, $B$ measures the spin $C$, which from $A$'s point of view is a unitary entangling operation: e.g., a $CNOT$.\n",

    "The whole crux of the matter is this: from its *own* perspective, a spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ is always $\\uparrow$. In other words, \"orientation\" is relative: from your own perspective, you're always \"up,\" and everyone else is tilted. So that if you had $\\mid \\uparrow \\rangle_{A}^{A} \\mid \\downarrow \\rangle_{B}^{A}$, then $\\mid \\uparrow \\rangle_{B}^{B} \\mid \\downarrow \\rangle_{A}^{B}$. $A$ and $B$ would each consider themselves to be $\\uparrow$ in their own terms, the other one being down.\n",

    "This is quite natural and intuitive classically. In the quantum case, however, there is a bit of a surprise with regard to how superposition and entanglement come into play.\n",

    "Conversely, if $B$ is regarded as $\\uparrow$, then: $(\\mid \\uparrow \\rangle - \\mid \\downarrow \\rangle)_{A}^{B} \\mid \\uparrow \\rangle_{B}^{B}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "There's still a 50/50 chance they agree, but $B$ would claim it was $A$ who was in a superposition. Why the negative sign? Because geometrically, if when $A$ is $\\uparrow$, $B$ is $\\rightarrow$, then when $B$ is $\\uparrow$, then $A$ would be $\\leftarrow$. Of course, $(\\mid \\uparrow \\rangle + \\mid \\downarrow \\rangle)_{A}^{B} \\mid \\uparrow \\rangle_{B}^{B}$ would have worked too, in the sense that the relative relationships are the same: the one is just the mirror image of the first.\n",

    "So far we've only worked with qubits, but check out <a href=\"examples/ref_frame.py\">ref_frame.py</a>! You can set some initial state, which should be the tensor product of several spin states, all with the same dimensionality, in other words, all spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$'s or all spin-$1$'s or all spin-$\\frac{3}{2}$'s, etc. Visually, you'll see a grid of spheres, each sphere representing a density matrix: the first row represents the subsystems from the POV of the first subsystem; the second row represents the subsystems from the POV of the second subsystem; and so on. So that along the diagonal, the states are all in the relevant $\\uparrow$ state: all the stars at Z+.

    "One question this brings up is: does this work if we have a collection of subsystems that live in *different* Hilbert spaces? In general, no. The whole idea depends on the relevant symmetry group being represented on each subspace: to wit, in the above, there has to be a way of rotating each of the subspaces. If we included position states, for example, we'd have to demand that they rotate in the correct way as well. And then we'd also have to take into account translations of position: each subsystem would regard itself at \"position 0,\" and so forth.\n",

    "What about a bunch of spins with different $j$ values? Well, it makes sense to take the POV of a spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ on a higher spin, since $SU(2)$ rotations can act on any spin-$j$; but not the reverse. On the other hand, one can work in the symmeterized tensor representation of spin, and take the perspective of a single symmeterized spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ which is part of a larger spin state. One interesting thing is that from such a POV, the rest of the spins may rearrange themselves into spin states with different $j$ values than you started with!\n"

    "Finally, it's worth mentioning that the idea of a \"quantum reference frame\" is often used in a related, but different sense. For example, suppose one wants to measure a spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ but lacks a reference frame for it, a set of $X, Y, Z$ directions. One could use, for example, a large spin-$j$ particle, in a coherent state with all the stars at the same location, as a reference. Since one lacks a frame of reference, all one can measure about the two particles is their total angular momentum, not any of the components of the angular momentum. By the Clebsch-Gordan decomposition, one will get a spin-$(j+\\frac{1}{2})$ state or a spin-$(j-\\frac{1}{2})$ state, each with a certain probability depending on the relative orientation of the spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ and the reference spin. And so one can try to deduce the relative orientation from these probabilities, perhaps of many different spins relative to the reference. But crucially, the more one employs the same big spin-$j$ as a reference, the more it degrades as a reference, until the probabilities don't tell you anything meaningful about the relative orientation. So that one models reference frames as a resource that can be exhausted. \n",
    "\n",
    "And finally, naturally, there is a relationship to \"covariant\" physics, since in principle all reference frames are systems *inside the universe*."
