    "# Envariance and the Origin of Probabilities in Quantum Mechanics\n",
    "\n",
    "This week I'd like to talk about some of Wojciech Zurek's ideas in the foundations of quantum mechanics. \n",
    "\n",
    "But first, a word of caution. Philosophically speaking, any time you try to prove something you have to choose a starting place, and the question is whether you can get from A to B. We're going to try to demonstrate how probabilities arise in quantum mechanics, but we're not going to start from scratch: we're going to assume all of unitary quantum mechanics, with its Hilbert spaces, tensor products, entanglements, and so forth. Indeed, Zurek's whole endeavor is to derive Born's rule for probabilities *from* a consideration of the nature of entanglement. In some sense, this could be seen as merely shuffling pieces around the board, substituting one mysterious things for another: e.g., we're not going to explain \"why entanglement\", but instead \"why probabilities given entanglement.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, there is some justification for this approach. After all, consider the lonely, isolated qubit in a pure state. There is, I think, a very real question about what exactly is \"quantum\" about it at all. A classical spinning object can be defined in terms of its oriented axis of rotation, and the phase of its rotation around that axis: in other words, a point on a sphere, and a point on a circle. And this is exactly, no more and no less, the information encoded in the qubit's state vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "We recall: given the state of a qubit quantized along the $Z$ axis, $\\mid \\phi \\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} \\alpha \\\\ \\beta \\end{pmatrix}$, we can interpret its two complex components as picking out a point on the sphere via $(\\langle \\phi \\mid X \\mid \\phi \\rangle, \\langle \\phi \\mid Y \\mid \\phi \\rangle, \\langle \\phi \\mid Z \\mid \\phi \\rangle)$, or more directly in terms of the complex ratio $\\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha}$, which, stereographically projected from the complex plane to the unit sphere, gives the point on the sphere. (If $\\alpha = 0$, we get end up at the South Pole, the point of projection). \n",
    "\n",
    "So in some sense, we're just working with a somewhat unfamiliar complex representation of a point on a sphere plus phase: the ratio between the two components specifies a point on the sphere up to multiplication by a complex number, the latter of which must be a phase (if we've demanded normalization $\\mid \\alpha \\mid^2 + \\mid \\beta \\mid^2 = 1$) which can represent the phase of the rotation around the given axis. (That we're working with a half integer representation of $SU(2)$ is not wholly relevant to the point here.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, we'd describe a point on the sphere in terms of cartesian coordinates as a \"superposition\" of basis states: $(1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1)$, each of which are orthogonal in \"real space\". In our complex representation, it happens that qubit states which are orthogonal complex vectors correspond to antipodal or opposite points on the sphere. So that we can describe a point on the sphere as a complex linear superposition of the vectors corresponding to *any* two opposite points on the sphere. Above, we chose the two points along the $Z$ axis, but any would do. \n",
    "\n",
    "So what's quantum about our qubit? The quantum part comes into play only when we consider how the qubit interacts with the world: when it is measured and when it gets entangled: and in some sense, these are the same thing from different perspectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original logical positivist genius of quantum mechanics was to describe systems as being in linear combinations of states *corresponding to outcomes to experiments*: these orthogonal states can all be encoded as the eigenvectors of some Hermitian operator, whose real eigenvalues correspond to the measured numerical values associated to outcomes (what had been, classically, position, momentum, etc.) The relevant experiment for the qubit is the Stern-Gerlach apparatus: send a spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ through the magnetic field and it ends up either taking the high road or the low road; and if it takes the high road, it's in the $\\mid \\uparrow \\rangle$ state relative to the Stern-Gerlach axis; and if it takes the down road, it's in the $\\mid \\downarrow \\rangle$ state. So these are the two outcomes: the two outcomes correspond to opposite points on the sphere. Each occurs with a certain probability. How do we get the probability? We describe the state of the qubit as a complex linear superposition $\\alpha \\mid \\uparrow \\rangle + \\beta \\mid \\downarrow \\rangle$, where $\\uparrow$ and $\\downarrow$ are along the axis of the magnetic field, and then the probabilities are given by the norm squared of the amplitudes, $Pr(\\uparrow) = \\mid \\alpha \\mid^2$ and $Pr(\\downarrow) = \\mid \\beta \\mid^2$. This is Born's rule. \n",
    "\n",
    "So what we approached first in purely geometrical terms now has this extra probabalistic overlay: what makes the qubit quantum is precisely how it behaves when we interact with it."

    "\n",
    "But we could take a third person perspective on the measurement interaction and describe it in terms of entanglement. After all, in the Stern-Gerlach experiment, we don't measure the qubit directly: we measure its position, which becomes entangled with the spin in the course of the unitary evolution instigated by the set-up.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\alpha \\mid \\uparrow \\rangle + \\beta \\mid \\downarrow \\rangle \\Rightarrow \\alpha \\mid \\uparrow \\Uparrow \\rangle + \\beta \\mid \\downarrow \\Downarrow \\rangle$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Operationally, if we measure the position, we get $\\mid \\Uparrow \\rangle$ or $\\mid \\Downarrow \\rangle$ with the same probabilities as before. Whatever answer we get, the qubit state will be perfectly correlated with the position state. This, after all, is what we mean by an accurate measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "But of course, we don't really measure the position directly either, but some proxy of it, so that, including all of various apparatuses in the picture, including in principle the photons by which the experimenter observes the outcome on the dial, even the neurons in the experimenter's brain that fire or don't fire depending on the outcome, we end up with a chain of entanglement:\n",

    "\n",
    "And yet when the buck does stop, we get an answer at random. Why? By exploring the implications of entanglement, we're going to try to resolve this question about probability."

The example he gave was the case of two cards: I place them both face down on the table, and I tell you one of them is a spade and one of them is a heart. What's the probability that when you turn one of them up, you get the spade? Obviously, we want to assign probability $\\frac{1}{2}$: but Laplace tries to make the reasoning behind this more rigorous.\n",

    "He asks: What if I swap the locations of the two cards, leaving them still facedown on the table? Does anything change for you? The answer is clearly no. And this is his key idea: he wants to ground the idea of assigning equal likelihood to spade or heart precisely in the fact that you're indifferent to the two cards being swapped. If you can swap the unknown cards, and it doesn't make any difference to you, then you ought to assign equal probabilities to heart and spade.\n",

    "This take on probability, however, was accused of being too subjective: after all, the situation is completely different for the person who chose the cards--after all, they know which one is which. And moreover, there is an objective fact about which card is which, even if I'm ignorant of it. All this would suggest that probabilities are solely subjective calculations relating to one's ignorance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other thinkers wanted to ground probability theory in more objective terms, without having to appeal to anyone's ignorance. And this gave birth to the frequentist approach, where one tries to ground probability theory in proportions of different outcomes in nominally identical situations. This, of course, has some difficulty in dealing with one-off events, and so perhaps one appeals to the objective physical symmetries of something, counting the number of ways the same outcome can occur, and so on."

    "On the one hand, it's quite natural to regard the measuring apparatus to have many states, and it's also quite natural to include the environment with many states as well into the picture, and to suppose that there will be a chain of maximal entanglement. What does seem strange is the part where we choose a special unitary transformation that seems to depend on the specific amplitudes of the state! It all worked because our amplitudes were $\\sqrt{\\frac{a}{n}}$ and $\\sqrt{\\frac{b}{n}}$, and we transformed to a basis where the qubit was entangled with an even superposition of $a$ basis states and an even superposition of $b$ basis states. Are we supposed to imagine that this transformation is really taking place; and what's more, is somehow sensitive to the amplitudes of the qubit themselves? \n",
    "\n",
    "One could say, and Zurek does say, that the important thing is that such a transformation is possible: it's a unitary transformation, and so we're perfectly within our rights to redescribe the state, and so characterize the entanglement in those terms. In other words, the state is such that, if we do describe it in this basis, then Born's rule for probabilities comes out naturally by envariance. This is an objective property of the state even if such a transformation isn't applied in the step-by-step way I laid out above. After all, we aren't using any old unitary on the system as a whole, which would trivially allow us to prove anything--we're just doing a basis shift on the apparatus (and environment)--which crucially, doesn't affect the *entanglement* at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, it's not impossible that such conditions do actually obtain in any realistic measurement set-up, and that these are precisely the conditions we're satisfying when we do successfully measure a quantum system, even if we didn't know that's what we were doing! This is an interesting question to settle experimentally.\n",
    "\n",
    "It also connects up with Zurek's other work on einselection and decoherence, which provides an analysis of how certain basis states (pointer states) come to be preferred by the continuous monitoring of a system by the environment. A pointer basis corresponds to an operator which commutes with the interaction Hamiltonian, and so that over time, due to decoherence, the density matrix of the system becomes diagonal in precisely that basis. It's also worth considering his other work on \"Quantum Darwinism,\" which is an analysis of how interactions with the environment lead to a kind of natural selection, whereby \"classical\" information about systems is able to reproduce itself in that environment, from which the original state can be reconstructed, giving the appearance of classical objectivity--after all, all our measurements are indirect reconstructions of this type.\n",

    "What if the apparatus doesn't have $n$ basis states? What happens then? Well, maybe those are the apparatuses we characterize as defective! After all, what we're really talking about is trying to characterize the amplitudes up to a certain accuracy. The same kind of argument can apply to the objection that sometimes irrational numbers may appear as amplitudes."

    "Finally, in what sense does this resolve the \"collapse\" issue? I think this can go in several different directions. On the one hand, one could use the envariance argument to support a Many-Worlds type picture, insofar as the envariance + finegraining argument obviates the usual objection that \"if all possibilities really occur\" then what role do the probabilities even serve? Here the probabilities are grounded operationally in the objective indifference under swaps and counterswaps, and because of the fine graining, it's perfectly fine to \"count the number of branches,\" and reason that there are more worlds/versions of you that encounter this outcome or that. In a sense, the probabilities could be seen as referring to \"which branch you'll find yourself in.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, I think the same arguments can also support a relational interpretation of quantum mechanics (and actually, in the end, I think these two interpretations are probably complementary to each other, the former emphasizing the global picture, and the the latter emphasizing the local). A maximally entangled state fully characterizes the correlations between two systems, leaving their individual states (in the case of spin, their orientations) undetermined. Another way of thinking about this is that the two systems have a perfectly definite orientation relative to each other, but no definite orientation to you. Thus when you force one of the systems to have a definite orientation relative to you by measurement, the result is random: but the two pictures of the world are made consistent by the entanglement, so that after your measurement, the qubits still agree. Now you and the spins have a definite relation to each other, but from another point of view, not part of this relation, you're all entangled and indeterminant. But one should be careful here in using phrases like \"from another perspective\" or \"from a 1st person vs a 3rd person perspective.\" By perspective we can mean many things, of which I'd like to distinguish three: a) our inner life, b) what we actually see with our eyes, c) the physical state of the world relative to us. Famously, special relativity predicts length contraction of objects in the direction of their motion, which of course, depends on the relative motion between you and the object. Ironically, this effect is actually invisible to the eye because if you follow the trajectories of light rays from the object, optical effects perfectly cancel out the relativistic effect. But by other evidence, from particle interactions, and so forth, it can be shown that length contraction really does effect the physics of things \"from your perspective.\" In other words, we all have a \"perspective\" on the physical world, which is different from our perspective in the subjective sense (or the optical sense). In other words, there is both a subjective and an objective kind of perspective, and it's in this latter sense that one can say, from a 1st person perspective, a definite outcome occurs with a certain probability, while from a 3rd person perspective, unitary evolution continues apace. The cleverness of the envariance argument is to derive the 1st person probability from the 3rd person entanglement."
