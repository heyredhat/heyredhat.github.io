    "A Von Neumann measurement consists in a choice of observable represented by a Hermitian operator $H$. Such an operator will have real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors. For example, $H$ could be the energy operator. Then the eigenvectors would represent possible energy states, and the eigenvalues would represent possible values of the energy (assuming no degeneracies). According to textbook quantum mechanics, which state the system ends up in after the measurement will in general be random, and quantum mechanics allows you to calculate the probabilities. The Hermitian observable provides what is known as a \"projection valued measure.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose our system was represented by a density matrix $\\rho$. We could form the projectors $P_{i} = \\mid v_{i} \\rangle \\langle v_{i} \\mid$, where $\\mid v_{i} \\rangle$ is the $i^{th}$ eigenvector. Then the probability for the $i^{th}$ outcome would be given by $Pr(i) = tr(P_{i}\\rho)$, and the state after measurement would be given by $\\frac{P_{i} \\rho P_{i}}{tr(P_{i}\\rho)}$. The expectation value of the observable $\\langle H \\rangle$ is given by $tr(H\\rho)$, and it amounts to a sum over the eigenvalues weighted by the corresponding probabilities.\n"

    "But there is a more general notion of measurement: a POVM (a positive operator valued measure). A POVM consists in a set of positive semidefinite operators that sum to the identity, i.e., a set $\\{E_{i}\\}$ such that $\\sum_{i} E_{i} = I$. Each *operator* corresponds to a possible outcome of the experiment, and whereas for a Von Neumann measurement, there would be $d$ possible outcomes, corresponding to the dimension of the Hilbert space, there can be *any* number of outcomes to a POVM measurement, as long as they all sum to the identity. The probability of an outcome, however, is similarly given by $Pr(i) = tr(E_{i}\\rho)$. If we write each $E_{i}$ as a product of so-called Krauss operators $E_{i} = A_{i}^{\\dagger}A_{i}$, then the state after measurement will be: $\\frac{A_{i}\\rho A_{i}^{\\dagger}}{tr(E_{i}\\rho)}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the case we'll be considering, however, the $\\{E_{i}\\}$ will be rank-1, and so the state after measurement will be $\\frac{\\Pi_{i}\\rho \\Pi_{i}}{tr(\\Pi_{i}\\rho)}$ as before, where $\\Pi_{i}$ are normalized projectors. (More on this later.)\n",

    "To implement POVM's, one will couple a system to an auxilliary system and make a measurement on the latter. We'll show how to do that in a little bit!\n",

    "A very special kind of POVM is a so-called SIC-POVM: a symmetric informationally complete positive operator valued measure. They've been conjectured to exist in all dimensions, and numerical evidence suggests this is the case.

For any quantum state $\\rho$, a SIC specifies a measurement *for which the probabilities of outcomes $p(i)$ specify $\\rho$ itself*. Normally, say in the case of a qubit, we'd have to measure expectation values $(\\langle X \\rangle, \\langle Y \\rangle, \\langle Z \\rangle)$ to nail down the state: in other words, we'd have to repeat many times three *different* measurements.

Clearly, this is equivalent to the usual Born Rule: but it's expressed entirely in terms of probabilities and conditional probabilities. It makes sense, in the end, that you can do this, given that the probabilities for the SIC-POVM measurement completely nail down the state. So we can just work with the probabilities instead!

Undignified as such a treatment may seem to some of my colleagues, I shall have to take account of this clash and explain a good many of the divergencies of philosophies by it. Of whatever temperament a professional philosopher is, he tries, when philosophizing, to sink the fact of his temperament. Temperament is no conventionally recognized reason, so he urges impersonal reasons only for his conclusions. Yet his temperament really gives him a stronger bias than any of his more strictly objective premises. It loads the evidence for him one way or the other ... just as this fact or that principle would. He trusts his temperament. Wanting a universe that suits it, he believes in any representation of the universe that does suit it.\"\n",

Why does he believe in primordial units of ‘mind-stuff’ on evidence which would seem quite worthless to Professor Bain? Simply because, like every human being of the slightest mental originality, he is peculiarly sensitive to evidence that bears in some one direction. It is utterly hopeless to try to exorcise such sensitiveness by calling it the disturbing subjective factor, and branding it as the root of all evil. ‘Subjective’ be it called! and ‘disturbing’ to those whom it foils! But if it helps those who, as Cicero says, “vim naturae magis sentiunt” [feel the force of nature more], it is good and not evil. Pretend what we may, the whole man within us is at work when we form our philosophical opinions. Intellect, will, taste, and passion co-operate just as they do in practical affairs...[I]n the forum [one] can make no claim, on the bare ground of his temperament, to superior discernment or authority. There arises thus a certain insincerity in our philosophic discussions: the potentest of all our premises is never mentioned. I am sure it would contribute to clearness if in these lectures we should break this rule and mention it, and I accordingly feel free to do so.\"\n",

All that its chance-character asserts about it is that there is something in it really of its own, something that is not the uncon- ditional property of the whole. If the whole wants this property, the whole must wait till it can get it, if it be a matter of chance. That the universe may actually be a sort of joint- stock society of this sort, in which the sharers have both limited liabilities and limited powers, is of course a simple and conceivable notion.\"\n",

    "To me this view seems deeply probable. Things cohere, but the act of cohesion itself implies but few conditions, and leaves the rest of their qualifications indeterminate. As the first three notes of a tune comport many end- ings, all melodious, but the tune is not named till a particular ending has actually come,—so the parts actually known of the universe may comport many ideally possible complements. But as the facts are not the complements, so the knowledge of the one is not the knowledge of the other in anything but the few necessary elements of which all must partake in order to be together at all. Why, if one act of knowl- edge could from one point take in the total perspective, with all mere possibilities abol- ished, should there ever have been anything more than that act? Why duplicate it by the tedious unrolling, inch by inch, of the foredone reality? No answer seems possible. On the other hand, if we stipulate only a partial community of partially independent powers, we see perfectly why no one part controls the whole view, but each detail must come and be actually given, before, in any special sense, it can be said to be determined at all. This is the moral view, the view that gives to other powers the same freedom it would have itself.\"\n",

Here I take the bull by the horns, and in spite of the whole crew of rationalists and monists, of whatever brand they be, I ask why not? Our acts, our turning-places, where we seem to ourselves to make ourselves and grow, are the parts of the world to which we are closest, the parts of which our knowledge is the most intimate and complete. Why should we not take them at their facevalue? Why may they not be the actual turning-places and growing-places which they seem to be, of the world—why not the workshop of being, where we catch fact in the making, so that nowhere may the world grow in any other kind of way than this?\"\n",

There must be a reason for our acts, and where in the last resort can any reason be looked for save in the material pressure or the logical compulsion of the total nature of the world? There can be but one real agent of growth, or seeming growth, anywhere, and that agent is the integral world itself. It may grow all-over, if growth there be, but that single parts should grow per se is irrational.\"\n",

The future has no ambiguous possibilities hidden in its womb; the part we call the present is compatible with only one totality. Any other future complement than the one fixed from eternity is impossible. The whole is in each and every part, and welds it with the rest into an absolute unity, an iron block, in which there can be no equivocation or shadow of turning.\"\n",

It admits that possibilities may be in excess of actualities, and that things not yet revealed to our knowledge may really in themselves be ambiguous. Of two alternative futures which we conceive, both may now be really possible; and the one become impossible only at the very moment when the other excludes it by becoming real itself. Indeterminism thus denies the world to be one unbending unit of fact. It says there is a certain ultimate pluralism in it.\"\n",

The laws must have come into being. Therefore they could not have been always a hundred percent accurate. That means that they are derivative, not primary. Also derivative, also not primary is the statistical law of distribution of the molecules of a dilute gas between two intersecting portions of a total volume. This law is always violated and yet always upheld. The individual molecules laugh at it; yet as they laugh they find themselves obeying it. ... Are the laws of physics of a similar statistical character? And if so, statistics of what? Of billions and billions of acts of observer-participancy which individually defy all law? . . .
