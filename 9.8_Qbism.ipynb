    "A Von Neumann measurement consists in a choice of observable represented by a Hermitian operator $H$. Such an operator will have real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors. For example, $H$ could be the energy operator. Then the eigenvectors would represent possible energy states, and the eigenvalues would represent possible values of the energy. According to textbook quantum mechanics, which state the system ends up in after a measurement will in general be random, and quantum mechanics allows you to calculate the probabilities. \n",

    "A Hermitian observable provides what is known as a \"projection valued measure.\" Suppose our system were represented by a density matrix $\\rho$. We could form the projectors $P_{i} = \\mid v_{i} \\rangle \\langle v_{i} \\mid$, where $\\mid v_{i} \\rangle$ is the $i^{th}$ eigenvector. Then the probability for the $i^{th}$ outcome would be given by $Pr(i) = tr(P_{i}\\rho)$, and the state after measurement would be given by $\\frac{P_{i} \\rho P_{i}}{tr(P_{i}\\rho)}$. Moreover, the expectation value of the observable $\\langle H \\rangle$ would be given by $tr(H\\rho)$, and it amounts to a sum over the eigenvalues weighted by the corresponding probabilities.\n"

    "But there is a more general notion of measurement: a POVM (a positive operator valued measure). A POVM consists in a set of positive semidefinite operators that sum to the identity, i.e., a set $\\{E_{i}\\}$ such that $\\sum_{i} E_{i} = I$. Each *operator* corresponds to a possible outcome of the experiment, and whereas for a Von Neumann measurement, assuming no degeneracies, there would be $d$ possible outcomes, corresponding to the dimension of the Hilbert space, there can be *any* number of outcomes to a POVM measurement, as long as all the associated operators sum to the identity. The probability of an outcome, however, is similarly given by $Pr(i) = tr(E_{i}\\rho)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we write each $E_{i}$ as a product of so-called Krauss operators $E_{i} = A_{i}^{\\dagger}A_{i}$, then the state after measurement will be: $\\frac{A_{i}\\rho A_{i}^{\\dagger}}{tr(E_{i}\\rho)}$. The Krauss operators, however, aren't uniquely defined by the POVM, and so the state after measurement will depend on its implementation: to implement POVM's, you couple your system to an auxilliary system and make a standard measurement on the latter. We'll show how to do that in a little bit!\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case we'll be considering, however, the $\\{E_{i}\\}$ will be rank-1, and so the state after measurement will be $\\frac{\\Pi_{i}\\rho \\Pi_{i}}{tr(\\Pi_{i}\\rho)}$ as before, where $\\Pi_{i}$ are normalized projectors associated to each element of the POVM (details to follow).\n",

    "A very special kind of POVM is a so-called SIC-POVM: a symmetric informationally complete positive operator valued measure. They've been conjectured to exist in all dimensions, and numerical evidence suggests this is indeed the case.

    "The key point is that for any quantum state $\\rho$, a SIC specifies a measurement *for which the probabilities of outcomes $p(i)$ specify $\\rho$ itself*. Normally, say, in the case of a qubit, we'd have to measure the separate expectation values $(\\langle X \\rangle, \\langle Y \\rangle, \\langle Z \\rangle)$ to nail down the state: in other words, we'd have to repeat many times three *different* measurements.

    "This brings up an important point.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might wonder: Suppose we have a SIC-POVM with $d^2$ elements which provides $d^2$ probabilities which completely nail down the quantum state, given as a $d \\times d$ density matrix. But what if we just start off with any old random vector of $d^2$ probabilities? Will we always get a valid density matrix? In other words, we've seen how we can start with quantum states, and then proceed to do quantum mechanics entirely in terms of probabilities and conditional probabilities. But now we're considering going in reverse. Does *any* assignment of probabilities to SIC-POVM outcomes specify a valid quantum state?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well: any probability assignment will give us a $\\rho$ which is Hermitian and has trace 1, which is great--BUT: this $\\rho$ may not be positive-semidefinite (which is a requirement for density matrices). Like: if you assigned any old probabilites to the SIC-POVM outcomes, and then constructed a correponding $\\rho$, it might end up having negative eigenvalues. Since the eigenvalues of $\\rho$ are supposed to be probabilities (positive, summing to 1, etc), this is a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we need another constraint. In other words, the quantum state space is a *proper subset* of the probability simplex over $d^2$ outcomes. There's some very interesting work exploring the geometric aspects of this constraint. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, insofar as pure states are those Hermitian matrices satisfying $tr(\\rho^2) = tr(\\rho^3) = 1$, we can evidently finagle this into two conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sum_{i}^{d^2} p(i)^2 = \\frac{2}{d(d+1)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "and\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sum_{i,j,k} c_{i, j, k}p(i)p(j)p(k) = \\frac{d+7}{(d+1)^3}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $c_{i, j, k} = \\Re{[tr(\\Pi_{i}\\Pi_{j}\\Pi_{k})]}$, which is a real-valued, completely symmetric three index tensor. The quantum state space is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull\">convex hull</a> of probability distributions satisfying these two equations. \n",
    "\n",
    "On this same note, considering our expression for the inner product, since we know that the inner product between two quantum states $\\rho$ and $\\sigma$ is bounded between $0$ and $1$, we must have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{1}{d(d+1)} \\leq \\vec{p} \\cdot \\vec{s} \\leq \\frac{2}{d(d+1)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The upper bound corresponds to our first condition. Call two vectors $\\vec{p}$ and $\\vec{s}$ \"consistent\" if their inner product obeys both inequalities. If we have a subset of the probability simplex for which every pair of vectors satisfies the inequalities, call it a \"germ.\" If adding one more vector to a germ makes the set inconsistent, call the germ \"maximal.\" And finally, call a maximal germ a \"qplex.\" The space of quantum states in the SIC representation form a qplex, but not all qplexes correspond to quantum state spaces. The geometry of the qplexes are explored in <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.03234\">Introducing the Qplex: A Novel Arena for Quantum Theory</a>. The conclusion?\n",
    "\n",
    "\"[Turning] to the problem of identifying the “missing assumption” which will serve to pick out quantum state space uniquely from the set of all qplexes... Of course, as is usual in such cases, there is more than one possibility. We identify one such assumption: the requirement that the symmetry group contain a subgroup isomorphic to the projective unitary group. This is a useful result because it means that we have a complete characterization of quantum state space in probabilistic terms. It also has an important corollary: That SIC existence in dimension d is equivalent to the existence of a certain kind of subgroup of the real orthogonal group in dimension $d^2 − 1$.\""

I can calculate the probabilities for the outcomes of the latter measurement using the law of total probability. Given the probabilities for the sky outcomes, and the conditional probabilities that relate ground outcomes to sky outcomes, I can calculate the probabilities for ground outcomes. Classically speaking, and this is the crucial point, I could use the first formula *whether or not I actually did the sky measurement*. \n",

We could actually perform the sky measurement or not: either way, we'd use the same formula to calculate the ground probabilities.\n",
    "\n",

In other words, outcomes aren't a special category: one can just speak of the properties of things. And this is just another way of saying you can use the law of total probability whether or not you actually do an intermediate measurement. But this is exactly what you can't rely on in quantum mechanics. \n",

    "de Finetti famously advocated a subjectivist, personalist view of classical probability theory, and he and his theorems have proved to be an inspiration for QBists like Christopher Fuchs and others. In this view, probabilities don't \"exist\" out in the world: they are mathematical representations of personal beliefs which you are free to update in the face of new evidence. There isn't ever \"one objective probability distribution\" for things: rather, there's a constant personal process of convergence towards better beliefs. If you don't want to make bad bets, there are some basic consistency criteria that your probabilities have to satisfy. And that's what probability theory as such amounts to. The rest is just \"priors.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "\"Statisticians for years had been speaking of how statistical sampling can reveal the 'unknown probability distribution'. But from de Finetti’s point of view, this makes as little sense as the unknown quantum state made for us. What de Finetti’s representation theorem established was that all this talk of an unknown probability was just that, talk. Instead, one could show that there was a way of thinking of the resultant of statistical sampling purely in terms of a transition from prior subjective probabilities (for the sampler himself) to posterior subjective probabilities (for the sampler himself). That is, every bit of statistical sampling from beginning to end wasn’t about revealing a true state of affairs (the “unknown probability”), but about the statistician’s own states of information about a set of “exchangeable” trials, full stop. The quantum de Finetti theorem does the same sort of thing, but for quantum states\" (Fuchs 2018).\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, QBists advocate a similar epistemic interpretation of the quantum state. The quantum state does not represent a quantum system. It represents *your beliefs about that quantum system*. In other words, interpretations that assign ontological roles to quantum states miss the mark. Quantum states are just packages of probabilities, indeed, probabilities personal to you. (In this sense, one can see a close relation to relational interpretations of quantum mechanics, where the quantum state is always defined not objectively, but to one system relative to another system.) Similarly, all the superstructure of quantum mechanics, operators, time evolution, etc-- are all just a matter of making subjective probabilities consistent with each other, given the *objective fact* that you should use the quantum formula when you haven't done an intermediate measurement, and the classical formula if you have. (And one should also mention that the formulas above imply that the *dimension* of the Hilbert space is, in fact, objective.)\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, QBists also hold that the very outcomes of measurements themselves are subjective--not in the sense of being vacuously open to intepretation, but in the sense that they are *experiences*; and it is precisely these subjective experiences that are being gambled upon. In other words, quantum mechanics is not a theory of the objective physical world as such, but is instead a first person theory by which one may predict the future consequences of one's own actions in experience. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is how they deal with the dilemma of Wigner's friend. Fuchs: \"...for the QBist, the real world, the one both agents are embedded in—with its objects and events—is taken for granted. What is not taken for granted is each agent's access to the parts of it he has not touched. Wigner holds two thoughts in his head: a) that his friend interacted with a quantum system, eliciting some consequences of the interaction for himself, and b) after the specified time, for any of Wigner's own future interactions with his friend or the system or both, he ought to gamble upon their consequences according to $U(\\rho \\otimes \\mid \\psi \\rangle \\langle \\psi \\mid) U^{\\dagger}$. One statement refers to the friend's potential experiences, and one refers to Wigner's own. So long as it is explicit that $U(\\rho \\otimes \\mid \\psi \\rangle \\langle \\psi \\mid) U^{\\dagger}$ refers to the latter--i.e., how Wigner should gamble upon the things that might happen to him--making no statement whatsoever about the former, there is no conflict. The world is filled with all the same things it was before quantum theory came along, like each of our experiences, that rock and that tree, and all the other things under the sun; it is just that quantum theory provides a calculus for gambling on each agent's experiences--it doesn't give anything other than that. It certainly doesn't give one agent the ability to conceptually pierce the other agent's personal experience. It is true that with enough effort Wigner [could apply the reverse unitary, disentangling the friend and the spin], causing him to predict that his friend will have amnesia to any future questions on his old measurement results. But we always knew Wigner could do that--a mallet to the head would have been good enough\" (Fuchs, Stacey 2019).\n",
    "\n",
    "Most assuredly, this is not a solipsistic theory: indeed, the actual results of measurement are precisely not within one's control. The way they imagine it is that whenever you set up an experiment, you divide the world into subject and object: the subject has the autonomy to set up the experiment, and the object has the autonomy to respond to the experiment. But the act of measurement itself is a kind of creation, a mutual experience which transcends the very distinction between subject and object itself, a linkage between oneself and the other. \"QBism says that when an agent reaches out and touches a quantum system—when he performs a quantum measurement—this process gives rise to birth in a nearly literal sense\" (Fuchs, Stacey 2019).\n",
    "\n",
    "The only conflict here is with a notion that the only valid physical theories are those that attempt to directly represent the universe \"in its totality as a pre-existing static system; an unchanging, monistic something that just *is*.\" Moreover, a theory like QBism clears a space for \"real particularity and 'interiority' in the world.\" For Wigner, considering his friend and the system, with his back turned, \"that phenomenon has an inside, a vitality that he takes no part in until he again interacts with one or both relevant pieces of it.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Often in the interpretation of quantum mechanics, one tries to achieve objectivity by focusing on the big bulky apparatuses we use and the \"objective\" record of outcomes left behind by these machines. The QBists take a different track: Bohr himself considers the analogy of a blind man seeing with a stick. He's not actively, rationally thinking about the stick and how it's skittering off this or that: rather, for him, it becomes an extension of his body: he *sees with the stick*. And thus one can understand Fuchs's three tenants of QBism:\n",

    "Indeed, one might wonder about entanglement in this picture. In line with the discussion of Wigner's friend, we can interpret entanglement and the use of tensor product itself as relating to the objective fact that we require a way of representing correlations while being completely agnostic about what is correlated insofar as we haven't yet reached out and \"touched\" the thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, in this sense, one can look at QBism as a completely \"local\" theory. An experimenter has one half of an entangled pair of spins, and makes a measurement, and has an experience. In the textbook way of thinking it, this causes the state of the other spin to immedietely collapse. QBism takes a different approach. They say: quantum theory allows the experimenter to predict that if they go over and measure the other spin in the same direction, they will have another experience, of the answers of the two particles being correlated. But just because quantum theory licenses the experimenter to assign a probability 1 for the latter outcome after they do the first measurement doesn't mean that the latter particle *really is now $\\uparrow$, say, as a property*. If the experimenter never actually goes to check out the other particle, it's yet another unperformed measurement: and it has no outcome yet. To paraphrase William James, if it isn't experienced, it isn't real. And in order to \"cash out\" on entanglement, one actually has to traverse the distance between the two particles and compare the results.\n",

Usually in science, we're mentally trying to constraint nature, applying concepts, laws, systems, to it, etc. QBism instead proposes that we live in a unfinished world, whose creation is ongoing and ceaseless, and that this profound openendedness is the real meaning behind \"quantum indeterminism.\" In itself, the universe is not governed by immutable laws and initial conditions fixed from the beginning: instead, new situations are coming into being all the time.

Also derivative, also not primary is the statistical law of distribution of the molecules of a dilute gas between two intersecting portions of a total volume. This law is always violated and yet always upheld. The individual molecules laugh at it; yet as they laugh they find themselves obeying it. ...

Bob’s verbal representation of his own experience can enter Alice’s, and vice-versa.

    "And yet, we know that quantum mechanics presents many faces, Bohmian deterministic faces, the many faces of Many Worlds, and so forth. It's beautiful, in a way: there's something for everybody. One is reminded of another passage from James:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The history of philosophy is to a great extent that of a certain clash of human temperaments. Undignified as such a treatment may seem to some of my colleagues, I shall have to take account of this clash and explain a good many of the divergencies of philosophies by it. Of whatever temperament a professional philosopher is, he tries, when philosophizing, to sink the fact of his temperament. Temperament is no conventionally recognized reason, so he urges impersonal reasons only for his conclusions. Yet his temperament really gives him a stronger bias than any of his more strictly objective premises. It loads the evidence for him one way or the other ... just as this fact or that principle would. He trusts his temperament. Wanting a universe that suits it, he believes in any representation of the universe that does suit it.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Why does Clifford fearlessly proclaim his belief in the conscious-automaton theory, although the ‘proofs’ before him are the same which make Mr. Lewes reject it? Why does he believe in primordial units of ‘mind-stuff’ on evidence which would seem quite worthless to Professor Bain? Simply because, like every human being of the slightest mental originality, he is peculiarly sensitive to evidence that bears in some one direction. It is utterly hopeless to try to exorcise such sensitiveness by calling it the disturbing subjective factor, and branding it as the root of all evil. ‘Subjective’ be it called! and ‘disturbing’ to those whom it foils! But if it helps those who, as Cicero says, “vim naturae magis sentiunt” [feel the force of nature more], it is good and not evil. Pretend what we may, the whole man within us is at work when we form our philosophical opinions. Intellect, will, taste, and passion co-operate just as they do in practical affairs...[I]n the forum [one] can make no claim, on the bare ground of his temperament, to superior discernment or authority. There arises thus a certain insincerity in our philosophic discussions: the potentest of all our premises is never mentioned. I am sure it would contribute to clearness if in these lectures we should break this rule and mention it, and I accordingly feel free to do so.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, for James, the value of a philosophy lies not so much in its proofs, but in the total vision that it expresses. As I say, perhaps the universe itself has something for everyone, whatever their temperament."

    "As a final word, it seems to me that QBism has taught us something genuinely new about quantum theory and its relationship to probability theory. On the other hand, it also pretends to be a theory of \"experience\": and yet, I'm not sure that I've learned anything new about experience. If QBism is to really prove itself, it will have to make novel predictions not just on the quantum side, but also on the side of our everyday perceptions. \n",
