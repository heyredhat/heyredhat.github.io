Each point is now encoded not individually in the separable qubits, but instead holistically in the state of the entangled whole. If we transform from the symmeterized qubits to the spin-$j$ state and find the roots of the Majorana polynomial, these complex roots, stereographically projected to the sphere, gives us back our original $(x, y, z)$ points. Of course, we have thrown out some information: namely, the phases of the individual qubits we symmeterized.\n",

So then when we apply the Fredkin, the two qubits to be symmetrized end up in *a superposition of being swapped and not being swapped*, relative to the control. We then apply a Hadamard again to the control, which by the way, is its own inverse ($H = H^{\\dagger}$), to undo that original rotation, while leaving it entangled with the two qubits.\n",

For example, for $3$ qubits, there are $3! = 6$ possible permutations, so we need a control state that is $6$ dimensional. We start with the control in its $\\mid 0 \\rangle$ state, and the apply the Hadamard in $n!$ dimensions, in other words, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Fourier_transform\">\"Quantum Fourier Transform,\"</a> which takes $\\mid 0 \\rangle$ to an even superposition of all its basis states. We then do a controlled operation, which makes performing the $i^{th}$ permutation on the $n$ qubits depend on the control being in the $\\mid i \\rangle$ basis state. So we end up with the $n$ qubits being in a superposition of being permuted in all possible ways, relative to the control. Then we apply the inverse QFT to the control, and then measure the control: if it ends up back in the $\\mid 0 \\rangle$ state, then the $n$ qubits are in the permutation symmetric state. Sweet!\n",

Suppose we wanted to go from our symmetrized state of $n$ qubits back to the separable state of $n$ qubits. If we've performed the measurement, and indeed, ended up in the symmetrized state, what happens? We apply the inverse of `QFT.dag()*CPERMS*QFT`: our control ends up in an even superposition as before, and then we condition the permutations on it... but we're in the permutation symmetric state, so it has no effect! \n",

Because of linearity, if we apply operations on the qubits, those operations are applied \"in each possible world,\" including the one where they end up totally symmetrized, so a) we can always wait until later to actually measure the control, if we want, and it'll be just as if we measured the control, and then manipulated the symmetrized state; and b) we can apply the above circuit in reverse, and obtain a state of separable qubits whose \"stars\" have evolved in just the right way.

    "Okay, the final concern you might have is that our control system is $n!$ dimensions, where $n$ is the number of qubits we want to symmetrize. We, however, want to formulate *everything* in terms of qubits. Is there a way of using several qubits as controls to get the same effect? Yes! And here's how:\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's define:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ R_{k} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k+1}} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -\\sqrt{k} \\\\ \\sqrt{k} & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ T_{j,j+1} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k-j+1}} \\begin{bmatrix} \\sqrt{k-j+1} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & \\sqrt{k-j} & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\sqrt{k-j} & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & \\sqrt{k-j+1} \\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The point of these guys it to prepare our control qubits. If we have $k$ control qubits in the $\\mid 0, 0, 0, \\dots \\rangle$ state, if we apply $R_{k}$ to the first qubit, and $T_{j, j+1}$'s to adjacent qubits along the line (from $j=1$ to $j = k-1$), then we'll end up in the state:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k+1}}(\\mid 00 \\dots 0 \\rangle + \\mid 10 \\dots 0 \\rangle + \\mid 01 \\dots 0 \\rangle + \\mid 00 \\dots 1 \\rangle)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, a superposition over all the qubits being $\\uparrow$ or just one of the qubits being $\\downarrow$. (Recall in this notation $\\mid 0 \\rangle$ = $\\mid \\uparrow \\rangle$, etc.) This is the qubit equivalent of our control qudit from before being prepared in an even superposition of all its basis states. Call this whole procedure $U_{k}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we have $k$ control qubits prepared. Here's the key: this is in the context of having *already symmetrized* $k$ qubits and we want to symmetrize an additional $k+1^{th}$ qubit. Having prepared the $k$ control qubits, we apply $k$ Fredkin gates. If $j$ runs from $1$ to $k$, then the $j^{th}$ Fredkin uses the $j^{th}$ control qubit to condition the swapping of the $j^{th}$ and $k+1^{th}$ qubits. Then, we as before apply the inverse of the preparation of the control qubits, $U_{k}^{\\dagger}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, so the whole point is to \"cascade the above construction\" for $k = 1,2,\\dots,n-1$, where $n$ is the number of qubits we want to symmetrize. So we start with $k=1$: we've \"already symmetrized\" one qubit and we want to symmetrize the next one, so we introduce $k=1$ control qubits, preparing them, and then fredkin-ing, and unpreparing. Then we move on to $k=2$, and we add two more control qubits, prepare them, fredkin, and unprepare, etc. In the end, we'll need $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ control qubits in total: so if $n=4$, we have $\\frac{4(4-1)}{2} = 6$ control qubits. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we measure all the controls, and if they're all in the $0/\\uparrow$ state, then our qubits will have been symmetrized!\n",
