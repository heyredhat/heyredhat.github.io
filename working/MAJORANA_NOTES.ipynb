    "We're free to multiply this complex vector by any complex number and this won't change the point it represents on the sphere. So our complex 2D vector corresponds to a direction in 3D, a length, and a phase. It can therefore represent a classical spinning object: the direction being the axis of rotation, the length being the speed of rotation, and the phase being how far it's turned around the axis at a given moment. It could also represent an incoming classical photon, which is specified by a 3D direction, with a certain color (length), and polarization (phase). Generally, unnormalized 2D complex vectors are referred to as spinors. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we normalize the vector so its length is 1, we can view it as the state of a qubit: for example, the spin angular momentum of a spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ quantum particle. In that case, the rotation axis picked out can only be inferred as a statistical average. Looking ahead: supposing we've quantized along the Z-axis, then $aa^{*}$ is the probability of measuring this qubit to be $\\uparrow$ along the Z direction, and $bb^{*}$ is the probability of measuring it to be $\\downarrow$. Here, \"quantized along the Z-axis\" just means that we take eigenstates of the Pauli Z operator to be our basis states (so that each component of our complex vector weights one of those eigenstates). The point I want to make here is that the normalization condition is necessary for us to be able to interpret $|a|^{2}$ as a probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth noting that if we take the normalization condition, $aa^{*} + bb^{*} = 1$, and expand out the complex and imaginary parts of each, we get: $\\alpha^{2} + \\beta^{2} + \\gamma^{2} + \\delta^{2} = 1$. If $\\alpha^{2} + \\beta^{2} = 1$ is a point on a circle, and $\\alpha^{2} + \\beta^{2} + \\gamma^{2} = 1$ is a point on a sphere, then $\\alpha^{2} + \\beta^{2} + \\gamma^{2} + \\delta^{2} = 1$ is a point on a 3-sphere: the 3-sphere lives in four dimensional space, and just as a circle is a 1D space that loops back on itself, so that if you go too far in one direction, you come out in the opposite direction, and the sphere is a 2D space that loops around, you can think of the 3-sphere as a 3D space that if you go forever in one direction, you loop back around. But we also know from the above, that we can break down a point on a 3-sphere as: a point on a 2-sphere, plus a complex phase, a point on the circle. This is known as the \"Hopf fibration.\" The idea is that you can think of the 2-sphere as a \"base space\" with a little \"fiber\" (the phase) living above each point. There's actually 4 of these (non-trivial) fibrations, corresponding to the 4 division algebras. The 1-sphere breaks into 1-sphere with a 0-sphere (just two equidistant points!) at each point (related to the reals). The 3-sphere breaks into the 2-sphere with a 1-sphere at each point (related to the complex numbers). The 7-sphere breaks into a 4-sphere with a 3-sphere living at each point (related to the quaternions). And a 15-sphere breaks into an 8-sphere with a 7-sphere living at each point (related to the octonians). Others can go into more detail (such as John Baez)!

    "If you're interested in learning more about the Majorana stars, it's worth noting that you can calculate a lot of crucial things just from the stars alone. There are formulas for the inner product given two constellations. You can calculate from the movement of the stars, the areas swept out by them and so forth, the so-called geometric phase. You can even treat generating random polynomials as a way of sampling constellations, and use this to analyze astronomical statistics, to see if there is a divergence from randomness in the intensities arriving from different directions. Penrose and Zimba use the Majorana representation in a famous proof of quantum contextuality.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the earliest use of \"constellations\"  was in dealing with the symmetry groups of crystals. Maxwell employed something similar to the Majorana construction, expanding the electromagnetic field at a given point in terms of \"multipole vectors.\" I recently learned there's an intimate relationship between quantum spin and Bezier curves, the components of the $\\mid j, m \\rangle$ vector being like the control points of a complexified Bezier curve!  And much much more. \n",

It's quite amazing that we can view a quantum spin-$j$ state as a juxtaposition of $2j$ classical states of a spinning top. There is a theory that generalizes this idea called \"Geometric Quantization,\" which is worth looking into: one investigates under what conditions copies of a classical system can be interpreted as states of a corresponding quantum system. \n",

    "It says: if you arrange n non-coincident points in 3D, and then imagine a little sphere around each point, and imagine drawing straight lines between the points, when lines intersect the spheres, put a star at each intersection point. So each point has a constellation on a sphere associated to it which is its \"view\" of the other points. So we have $n$ constellations, each of $n-1$ stars. We can interpret these $n-1$ stars as an $n$ dimensional spin state, or as polynomials. Atiyah has conjectured, and no one has found a counterexample, that these states always form a linearly independent basis for constellations of $n-1$ stars. In other words, the mutual views of points arranged in 3D always form a linearly independent basis of the space of possible views. Of course, not all collections of constellations form consistent views. Nor is this in general an orthogonal basis, and so the components can't be interpreted so neatly as probability amplitudes. But given a $n-1$ star constellation, we can express it in the basis provided by a collection of $n$ views, and so give a kind of weight to the degree to which that constellation is \"at\" those vantage points.\n",

    "\n",
    "In any case, Atiyah generalizes his conjecture to hyperbolic space, Minkowski space, curved space, more general manifolds. And I have to note that he arrived at the conjecture following up on Berry and Robbin's attempt at proving the spin-statistics theorem (which says that half-integer spin particles are antisymmetric under exchange in space (fermions) whereas integer spin particles are symmetric under exchange in space (bosons)) without invoking relativistic quantum field theory. The proof hinges on the use of the oscillator representation, using four oscillators to represent two spins, and building X, Y, Z rotation operators that act *across* the spins, rotating the one into the other--we shall soon learn this trick!)"

This is precisely what makes quantum mechanics special, irriducible to classical mechanics.

And if we permute the order of the two subspaces, it remains the same. \n",

And we interpret these basic representations as something like classical phase spaces (as we do in the case of the oscillator (with the position/momentum plane) and the spin (the angular momentum sphere)). At the same time, we can interpret the resulting second quantized theory as a superposition of a whole tower of different representations with different numbers of particles: and what is counted is precisely the number of $0$'s in these representations, in other words: the number of *forbidden* classical states. A set of constellations of forbidden states is equivalent to all the magic of the permutation symmetric tensor product by the laws of algebra.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, you could say: what is countable in quantum mechanics is the number of classical states forbidden together. This picture is dual to: for particles to be countable in quantum mechanics, they must be indistinguishable, unordered with respect to the tensor product. This is philosophically satisfying. If the particles weren't indistinguishable, we couldn't justifiably model them like: unordered pebbles in a pile, indeed, with: numbers. Again, classically, when we combine systems, the only way the systems can be unordered is for them to be in exactly the same state. But because of the possibility of entangled superpositions in the quantum mechanical tensor product, the countable states are much more interesting--for example $\\mid \\uparrow \\downarrow \\rangle + \\mid \\downarrow \\uparrow \\rangle$, which is permutation symmetric--and allow for a much richer structure. From this the whole theory of second quantization follows. The vastness of quantum mechanics is practically reduced down to the science of what can be counted simultaneously, which provides context for a pile of pebbles.\n",
    "\n",
    "To close: you might wonder if we can continue the construction. Recall in category theory, a category consists in \"objects\" and \"morphisms,\" and a functor maps one category to another one, objects to objects, morphisms to morphisms. When we second quantize, we map single particle states to states in the Fock space, and single particle operators to operators on the Fock space. Following <a href=\"http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/nth_quantization.html\"> John Baez</a>, we could imagine this ladder:\n",
    "\n",
    "Zeroth quantization is hit a set with a functor, which takes each element of the set to a basis vector in some Hilbert space, where the dimensionality of the space is the size of the set. We start with the empty set, and get the 0-dimensional Hilbert space.\n",
    "\n",
    "We define a \"second quantization functor,\" which takes a Hilbert space to the Fock space built atop it: in other words, the tensor product of $d$ harmonic oscillators, where $d$ is the dimensionality of the original Hilbert space. \n",
    "\n",
    "First quantization: we hit the 0-dim Hilbert space with the \"second quantization functor\" and get: $C$, the complex numbers, since we have only one basis vector $\\mid \\rangle$, with an amplitude: we live in the 1-dim Hilbert space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second quantization: hit the 1-dim Hilbert space with the \"second quantization functor\" and get the quantum harmonic oscillator, which counts an arbitrary finite collection of indistinguishable quanta: some number of $\\mid \\rangle$'s: $\\mid 0 \\rangle, \\mid 1 \\rangle, \\mid 2 \\rangle, \\dots$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third quantization: introduce a harmonic oscillator *for each state of a harmonic oscillator*. Each state consists of a finite multiset like: $\\mid \\mid 1,1,1\\rangle, \\mid 1 \\rangle, \\mid 1, 1 \\rangle\\rangle = \\mid 3, 1, 2\\rangle$, where the order doesn't matter. In other words, we can interpret this as an unordered \"pile\" of a variable number of harmonic oscillators. Now, for example, we could be in a superposition of representations of $SU(2)$ and $SU(3)$, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fascinatingly, we can think of this as the Hilbert space of the right-moving modes of a quantum string--you know, in string theory. The idea is you can interpret these states as states of a massless scalar field theory on a cylindrical spacetime, where the momentum of each particle corresponds to the the different number states of the oscillators: e.g., $\\mid 3, 1, 2\\rangle$ has 1 particle with momentum 3, 1 particle with momentum 1, and 1 particle with momentum 2. And if we simply upgrade the number operator from the previous level, we get the right Hamiltonian for the massless scalar field on the cylindrical spacetime. If we tensor another copy of this, to get left-moving modes, we have the complete theory, which can be interpreted this as a string evolving in 1-dim spacetime. It's quite clear that in an almost trivial sense, string theory works: we have a whole pile of oscillators to play with, and we can use them to represent tons of symmetry groups using our bag of tricks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fourth quantization: a multiset of multisets of oscillators, an arbitrary collection of indistinguishable strings. \n",
    "\n",
    "But why stop there? (Indeed, count: $1, 2, 3, \\dots$ and there's no reason to ever stop.)\n",
    "\n",
    "A more interesting question to ask is: given that indistinguishability is so basic to the theory, what story can we tell about how *distinguishability* emerges? Indeed, what's interesting is that: even if in field theory, the particles are indistinguishable, by being able to measure the number of particles $here$, we are able to make a distinction.\n"
